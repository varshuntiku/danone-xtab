Survey of Buyer’s Choice: This method involves directly interviewing potential customers to understand their future purchase plans. It can be conducted through a complete enumeration method, a sample survey method, or an end-use method. Collective Opinion Method: This approach uses the estimates of a company's salesforce to predict future sales, taking into account factors like changes in selling price, product designs, competition, and consumer purchasing power​. Delphi Technique: Involves a group of experts providing forecasts and justifications, which are then shared among the panel for refinement until a consensus is reached. ",
