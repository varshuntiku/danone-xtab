        "input":"While watching a swimming competition one night, I came across an unbelievable sight. It was not a gold medal, or a world record broken, but a show of courage. The event started with only three men on the blocks. For one reason or another, two of them false started, so they were disqualified. That left only one to complete. In fact, it is difficult enough, not having anyone to race against. I watched the man dive off the block and knew right away that something was wrong. I'm not an expert swimmer, but I can tell a good dive from a poor one, and this was not exactly medal quality. When he resurfaced, it was obvious that the man was not out for gold -- his arms were waving in an attempt at freestyle. The crowd started to laugh. Clearly this man was not a medal competitor. I listened to the crowd beginning to laugh at this poor man who was clearly having a hard time. Finally he made his turn to start back. It was pitiful. He made a few desperate strokes   and you could tell he was exhausted. But in those few awful strokes, the crowd had changed. No longer were they laughing, but beginning to cheer. Some even began to stand and shout \"Come on, you can do it!\" and he did. This young man finally finished his race. The crowd went wild. Even though he recorded one of the slowest times in swimming history, this man gave more heart than any of the other competitors. Just a short year ago, he had never even swum, let alone race. His country had been invited to the competition. In a competition, we usually watch the brilliant athletes competing for medals, but _ .

        "input":"The South Korean Ministry of education is investing $ 2.4 billion into making the country's school system completely digital. The plan is to get rid of textbooks and replace them with digital learning materials stored in a central database, which students would get into with PCs. Though some digital education programs have been tried in the U.S. and other countries, few can match the South Korean plan. While it will certainly be interesting to spread out, a completely paperless school system will surely stand for other countries to follow. Perhaps the digital learning revolution will have its start in Seoul. The digital developments have improved our personal lives. It was a matter of time before they would finally have an effect on other fields. It's an exciting time in education--whether you're a CEO setting plans for growth, an IT expert making new technology decisions or an educator giving lively courses. All of us are connected by the movement of a more digital campus. Today's generation has integrated web-based technology into their daily lives. Expectations are forming: lively content-anytime, anywhere and on any equipment. And those expectations aren't just for fun--they're spreading into the educational space as well. Expanding our digital footprint isn't just an excitement-it's a necessity.  And CEOs and IT experts aren't the only ones feeling the pressure to improve--educators are as well. More and more studies report a change from teaching to learning--moving away from giving lectures of facts to encouraging skills of self-study, analysis and learning paths ; from courses built using a single textbook to numbers of available publisher materials ; and from dull content to lively digital advantages that connect the learners, providing real-time response.  Students aren't the only ones benefiting from this change. Educators can now easily build lively online courses while increasing student outcomes. Why does the author take the South Korean's decision for example?\nA.To introduce digital education's role and value.\nB.To prove even a small country has a great dream.\nC.To call on all the countries to carry out digital education.\nD.To persuade American government to carry out digital education.\nAnswer:",

At that time, anything seemed more exciting than young. But now as grownups, some adults find they cannot leave childhood behind. They become \"kidults\"(kid+adult). Being a kidult has become a lifestyle choice among young people across Asia. Some kidults collect toys they once played with. Hello Kitty, Garfield, and Snoopy have many adult fans around the world. It is not unusual to see a 20something woman with a big, Garfieldshaped cushion on her sofa or a Hello Kitty mobile phone accessory . Other kidults still enjoy children's stories and fairy tales. For example, even an edition of the Harry Potter novels with an adult cover came out in Britain. That way, no one else on the subway will know that an adult is actually reading a children's book! \"Kidults can be like vitamins to society. Adults who value their childhood and hold on to pure, childlike emotion may be needed in such a rough and dry society,\" said a professor in a Korean University. He added that kidult culture might fill the generation gap between adults and kids. It could give children and their parents books, movies, and cartoon shows to enjoy together. Tim Greenhalgh, a professor in London explained that some kidults just refuse to grow up. They cling to  childhood because life in a busy and stressful city frightens them. Kidults would like to forget their age and openly show their fear of society and adulthood. \"So, they look for an escape from increasingly complex and stressful life that are hard to deal with,\" Greenhalgh said.

Tokelau's three main atolls ,or islands,now have enough solar capacity to meet all of their electricity needs.Until now.Tokelau has been 100%dependent on diesel   for producing electricity.That has burdened the country with heavy economic and environmental costs. The three atolls of Tokelau are about halfway between New Zealand and Hawaii and are administered by New Zealand. Each atoll received its own solar power grid  system.New Zealand officials estimated the cost of the project to build the three solar grids at around seven million dollars.The last of the grids has been completed. It is estimated that oil imports make up to 30%of national income in some parts of the Pacific.The move to solar power could save Tokelau about one million dollars a year.Tokelau will now be able to spend more on social programs to help its citizens. Other South Pacific islands are attempting similar projects.The island nations of Samoa and Tuvalu are aiming to get all of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020.The Cook Islands plans to start moving to solar panels and wind turbines.And most houses in the South Pacific groups of islands will begin to use solar water heaters.

        "input":"Europe's deadly outbreak of a rare form of E. coli bacteria   has brought new attention to food safety issues. One of the problems when people get sick from food is that the simplest question is often difficult or even impossible to answer. Just what did the people eat that made them sick? Of course, one way to avoid these medical mysteries is to keep dangerous organisms out of the food supply. This is easier said than done, but scientists keep looking for new ways. Scientists in the United States have developed an experimental system that uses a high-tech optical scanner. The system is designed to identify the presence of contaminants  like soil or animal waste on fresh produce. These can be sources of E. coli. E. coli bacteria naturally live in the intestines  of humans and many animals. Most kinds of E. coli are harmless but some can make people sick. The new scanner can also show damage and imperfections that might make the produce unappealing to shoppers. Scientists designed the system at a Department of Agriculture research center in Beltsville, Maryland. Moon Kim of the Agricultural Research Service led the team. MOON KIM: \"We were requested, we were asked, to develop a method to detect contamination in produce. So we started with the apple as the model sample.\" The scanner uses a high-speed camera placed over the conveyer belt that moves the produce along. As the apples move along the belt, the scanner captures images of each piece of fruit. Moon Kim says the team hopes the system will be available before long. MOON KIM: \"We are targeting for development in commercial plants for the next several years.\" The scanner can direct a sorting machine to separate the bad apples from the good ones. The system is currently able to show the surface of only half the apple as it speeds by. The inventers hope to improve the process so it can show the whole surface.

Usually, it is done in a city environment. Practicers take very wall or roof as their training place. If you have seen the beginning of the James Bond movie Casino Royale, then you have seen an excellent example of parkour. David Belle, a young Frenchman, developed parkour in the 1990s. His father's experiences as a fireman as well as an acrobat influenced him a lot. His childhood friend, Sebastien Foucan, is the actor in the movie Casino Royale with his parkour performance. Foucan is thought to have developed free-running, which is a more artistic and skillful type of parkour. David belle traveled to India and said one way he trained was by watching a physical one. The aim is to become so skillful, and it is almost unnecessary for you to think about the different actions in running through a path full of barriers . Parkour is not exactly a sport. It is not developed fro competition. It is more about learning to control mind and body in difficult situations. There are many basic movements in parkour. One example is where practicers swing through the narrow space between two bars while keeping their body level with the ground. This is called the underbar. Other movements are the tic-tac and the kong vault jump. Skillful practicers seem to get out of control of gravity. The popularity has spread largely because of parkour videos and organizations on the Internet. And if you search on the Web, you will find parkour groups performing their skills near you.

Incomes have risen, unemployment has fallen, and cities such as New York are bursting with new office buildings. But just a short walk from Manhattan's skyscrapers, George Brown sits on the side-walk, cooking a lunch of rice and bits of fish over a can of cooking fuel. Brown is homeless----one of the 2.3 million people in the US who end up on the street. During the day, Brown collects aluminum cans and sells them for five cents a piece. At night, he sleeps on the street. \"I have been on the street about eight or nine years, something like that,\" said the 62-year-old former construction worker. Brown admits he had problems with alcohol and has smoked cocaine. But he said he still wants a more stable housing arrangement. He could afford it just with the money he earns by collecting cans and small pieces of metal, if only truly low-income housing were available. However, he sees no hope of finding affordable housing in New York. With the strong economy and unemployment down, beautiful housing is being built to meet demand. A US report shows rents in New York City rose more than 27 per cent, from $549 to $700 a month. One of the side effects of the strong economy is that rents have been going up. The majority of people who experience homelessness really just need some affordable housing help. But few housing companies are building for the poor. Many small apartments in the city now rent for $1,500 a month or more. Brown, the homeless New Yorker, said he has a daughter who lives in the city but he rarely sees her.

        "input":"In ancient Greek mythology we learn about a young man named Narcissus. He was so beautiful that he fell in love with his own reflection  . He became obsessed  , but soon realized that what he loved was not real. As a result, he became sad and died. In the place where he had stood appeared a soft yellow flower -a narcissus. This is where the word \"narcissism\" came from. Unfortunately, narcissism is often used to show disapproval because it is usually used to mean being self-centered and not caring about others. However, part of the reason that narcissism carries these negative meanings is that many people admire themselves in an unhealthy way. But the truth is that good self-love is necessary for our mental health, scientists say. A study published 10 years ago shows that low self-esteem is responsible for many social problems, and it can affect teenagers seriously. When they feel less confident and not as good as their classmates, teenagers are more likely to suffer from depression, commit suicide, get pregnant and bully others, according to the BBC. The other reason that narcissism is considered an ugly thing is because we are taught that we should care more about others than ourselves and that it's better to give than to receive.  Thinking about others is the right thing to do, without question. But psychologists say that the love of others is actually based on self-love. If you see yourself as an unpleasant stranger, how can you be capable of making friends with anyone else? After all, you are closer to yourself than anyone else. After years of study, scientists also found that parents play a big part in building a child's self-belief. Only if the parents approve and accept their children, do they feel loved and learn to love themselves. The next time you look in the mirror, try to tell yourself that you are one of a kind. Pick out your best qualities and be proud of yourself.

Each year around 6.5 to 7 million people come to enjoy the miles of sandy beaches, the 158m Black pool Tower and the 11km-long Golden Mile, where there are entertainments, pubs, ice rinks   and even a zoo. On the south coast of the country you can find Brighton. Until 1786, Brighton was a sleepy village. Then the future king, George IV, decided to build a house there, and now it has become a large, international centre. Apart from the beaches, Brighton is famous for its pier  . There are theatres, entertainments and restaurants there. Brighton is also fantastic for shopping. If you want to travel a little further, why not go to Corn-wall in the far southwest of the UK? South Cornwall offers miles of sandy beaches and beautiful scenery. The climate there is warmer than the rest of Britain, and you can even find palm trees. For a bit more excitement, go to North Cornwall. The scenery there is nicer, and the beaches are famous for their powerful waves. As a result, North Cornwall has become the home of British surfing.

The review explains that smell is unique in its effects on the brain.According to Conrad King,the researcher who carried out the review,\"more than any other senses,the sense of smell goes through the logical part of the brain and acts on the systems concerned with feelings.This is why the smell of baking bread can destroy the best intentions of a dieter.\" Smell,which dictates the unbelievable complexity of food tastes,has always been the least understood of our senses.Our noses are able to detect up to 10,000distinct smells.Our ability to smell and taste this extremely large range of smells is controlled by something like 1,000genes  ,which make up an amazing 3% of the human genome.Researchers Richard Axel and Linda Buck were together awarded a Nobel Prize in 2004for their ground-breaking research on the nature of this extraordinary sense.These two scientists were the first to describe the family of 1,000olfactory   genes and to explain how our olfactory system works. According to one study in the research review,smelling fresh pizza or even the packaging of fast foods can be enough to make drivers feel impatient with other road users.They are then more likely to speed and experience uncontrollable anger on roads.The most reasonable explanation is that these can all make drivers feel hungry,and therefore desperate to satisfy their appetites. In contrast,the smells of peppermint and cinnamon were shown to improve concentration levels as well as reduce drivers'impatience.Similarly,the smells of lemon and coffee appeared to promote clear thinking and mental focus. However,the way genes regulate smell differs from person to person.A study by researchers in Israel has identified at least 50olfactory genes which are switched on in some people and not in others.They believe this may explain why some of us love some smells and tastes while others hate them.The Israel researchers say their study shows that nearly every human being shows a different pattern of active and inactive smell-detecting receptors.

A small hole drilled into the earth became a passage to freedom for 33 trapped miners, who spent 69 days underground. \"Never have people been trapped for so long so deeply,\" says a doctor at NASA, the American space agency, which helped in the rescue. But the chief medical officer for the miners said most are in good enough health to leave the hospital within a day or so. The first three recovered and went home Thursday night. For much of the day the miners relaxed with Chilean President Sebastian Pinera. The 32 Chileans and 1 Bolivian still wore special sunglasses to protect their eyes. A partial mine collapse on 5th August trapped them more than half a kilometer underground. They had to stretch a two-day food supply. For two weeks no one knew if they were alive or dead. Later, they received supplies. The first miner rescued on Wednesday was Florencio Avalos. The second was Mario Sepulveda, who talked about how the experience tested his faith. The last miner up was Luis Urzua, who was the shift leader when his crew became trapped. Rescuers used a metal cage to pull the miners to safety in less than 24 hours -- faster than expected. The rescue capsule was a half-meter wide and known as the Phoenix, an imaginary bird from ancient stories. It bursts into flames but is continually reborn and rises from the ashes. Chile's Navy built the capsule with advice from mining experts and NASA engineers. It worked like an elevator, traveling up and down on a cable through a shaft drilled 622 meters into the rocks. Millions of people around the world watched the rescue. More than one thousand journalists traveled to the mine in the Atacama Desert to report on the rescue. They joined family members of the miners and rescue crews housed in an area of tents known as Camp Hope.

So far he's only ridden across the United States and part of Australia. He recently took a year off to write a book about his trip. Circling the globe has a long history. In 1901, Captain Voss (from Canada) set off around the world in a 12-metre dugout canoe . Even more impressive, the canoe, which Voss bought from a Native American woman, was built in the early 19th century. He armed the canoe with a Spanish cannon for protection. The journey took three years and, of course, Voss wrote about his trip in a book.

For more than 15 years,the Big Wind Kite Factory has been giving kitemaking and kiteflying classes for the children on an island in Hawaii.In its kitemaking lessons,students can make kites in as little as 20 minutes!Children as young as four years old can learn how to fly a kite.Jonathan Socher and his wife Daphne started the kite factory in 1980.Their kites are made of nylon .Their designs are Hawaiian themes created by Daphne.The designs are cut out of the nylon with a hot knife that seals the edges and then fastened directly onto the kite. The kite that is used to give lessons is a regular diamond kite with a rainbow pattern.The difference between this kite and the ones they make during the lessons is that it is a twostring controllable kite.Big Wind employees fly the kite and for a few minutes show students how pulling on one line and then on the other controls the direction the kite goes in.Then the controls are given to the students.

I complained, \"Everything has gone wrong.\" My wife and I were in one tent with our two young kids. A hundred yards east away was Summit Lake, where the glorious early morning mist was shimmering off the water. A couple miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet above sea level, and huge snow dotted the scenery even in mid August. Further west still was Bumpass Hell, with steam rising up. As the sun crept up over the edge of the Lassen peak, we fired up the camp stove and had breakfast. Half an hour later, my six-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen peak trail, getting ready to go up the mountainside. We wouldn't make it all the way, but it didn't matter.

        "input":"Throughout our childhood our parents taught us to say \"thank you\" and it has become a habit -- something we say automatically  , along with \"please\". And because of this we have forgotten just how important gratitude is and how essential it is in leading fulfilled   lives. Just for a minute, think of all the things you are grateful for, such as loving friends, good health, great holidays as well as everyday items such as a comfortable home, TV, and clean water. The list, in fact, could go on and on. Now focus on events that have made you angry -- it's raining, the car won't start, and a colleague   makes you annoyed. You start to feel unhappy, and that is something that certainly does not make you feel good! In fact, we have the ability to choose how we feel -- it's just our perception   of how things are. But for most of us, it just doesn't seem easy. Let me give you an example: it's a rainy day, and immediately most people will start to complain, telling everyone who will listen what a miserable day it is, with the result that they end up feeling miserable themselves. But look at it another way and despite wet clothes and hair, both will dry perfectly well and no lasting harm has been done. And in addition to this, because of rain, we not only live in a green and beautiful landscape, we are also able to grow a lot of fruit and vegetables. There really is no obvious reason for feeling miserable -- in fact there is a great deal to be grateful for. It all depends on what we think about things. Realize what a difference having gratitude can make to your life. That's why gratitude is so special -- use it to feel good!

According to the Union of Concerned Scientists(UCS), Biomass is a kind of renewaBle energy source that produces no carBon dioxide , Because the energy it contains comes from the sun. When plant matter is Burned, it gives off the sun's energy. In this way, Biomass serves as a sort of natural Battery  for storing the sun's energy.

For instance, an advanced speech recognition system will tell new parents why their baby is crying. This kind of thing is not possible today, but with an advanced enough system, it's actually possible.

Smart machines will also be able to smell.

Swimming pools, wine tasting, and pink sunsets(at normal evening hours, not 4 in the afternoon) filled the weekend, but the best part- particularly to my taste, dulled by months of cold- weather root vegetables- was a 7 a.m. adventure to the Sarasota farmers' market that proved to be more than worth the early wake-up call. The market, which was founded in 1979, sets up its tents every Saturday from 7:00 am to 1 p.m, rain or shine, along North Lemon and State streets. Baskets of perfect red strawberries, the red-painted sides of the Java Dawg coffee truck; and most of all, the tomatoes: amazing, large, soft and round red tomatoes.

If you search for Yoga on line in Chinese, lots of pages are there to see, most of which are main pages of Yoga clubs. In order to keep fit and lose weight, many girls spend more than 1000 yuan taking part in Yoga classes every month. However, are you really ready for it? There are several things you need to know before you really take it. First, do not force your body too much. Yoga has many difficult poses. They are beautiful and worth boasting if you could finish them. But if you force yourself to do as exactly as an experienced Yoga teacher does, you may hurt your body, instead of strengthening it. Do you remember you original purpose for playing Yoga? It is self -building, not competing.  Second, do some research about the Yoga class that you are to registering. Yoga is new in Chinaand there are not so many certificated well-trained Yoga teachers. Some not well organized clubs just find someone learn a little Yoga and certificate them. But be aware, a non- _ teacher might wrongly guide you and you could not benefit from the classes much except that they force you to exercise your body a bit. Considering about the large amount of money you invest in it, it's worth and reasonable to make sure the teachers in the club are qualified before you join.        Third, it would be better to learn something about nutrition when you practice Yoga. In the very beginning, Yoga was part of the Vedas, bible of the traditional Indian philosophy. So it could be regarded as a kind of lifestyle. When you have decided to care for your body, why not feed it properly? In fact, good clubs have their own nutritionists.

It is something far less pleasant, like being called in your boss to explain why you did this and did that, and why you did not do this or that. Terrible music, indeed, but it has to be faced. At some time or another, every one of us has had to \"face the music\", especially as children. We can remember father's angry voice: \"I want to talk to you!\" And only because we did not obey him. What an unpleasant business it was! The phrase \"face the music\" is known to every American, old and young. It is at least one hundred years old. Where did the expression come from? The first explanation came from the American novelist James Fenimore Cooper. He said, in 1851, that expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings   to go on stage. After they got their clue  to go on , they often said, \"It's time to go to face the music.\" And that is exactly what they did face the orchestra   which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience  that might be friendly, or perhaps unfriendly, especially if he forgot his . But he had to go out. If he did not, there would be no play. So \"face the music\" came to mean: having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice.

In the middle of the seventh inning fans ritualistically stand and stretch before the home team comes to bat.  No one really knows the origin of the custom, but there are theories on how it started. Baseball historian Dan Daniel provided this explanation: \"It probably began as an expression of fatigue. That would explain why the stretch comes late in the game instead of at the halfway point.\" A more popular story involves President William Howard Taft and the birth of two baseball traditions. According to the account, Taft attended the first game of the 1910 baseball season. On the spur of the moment, plate umpire  Billy Evans gave Taft the ball. He asked him to throw it over the plate. Taft did so, and the custom of having the president launch the baseball season with the first pitch was born.  The story continues that later that same day, President Taft, who weighed well over 300 pounds, became uncomfortable in his small chair. In the middle of the seventh inning, he stood up to stretch his legs. The crowd thought that the president was leaving, so they stood up out of respect. A few moments later, Taft sat down again. The fans followed, and the seventh-inning stretch was born. What a day for traditions! No matter how the tradition began, fans have since added to the fun. Now, as they stand to stretch during the seventh inning, they can sing along to Jack Norworth's 1927 version of the song \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" after the visiting team has batted.

It was less than three weeks away from his 113thbirthday. Record-keeping experts say he was the world's oldest man.          His long life and that of other very old Sardinians are the subjects of a scientific project called Akea. Luca Deiana of Sassari University is directing the study. He says the name Akea comes from a traditional greeting on Sardinia. It means\"health and life for 100 years\". Professor Deiana and his team started to collect information for the study in 1997. They identified more than 220 Sardinians who were centenarians--100years old or older. His team required three documents to confirm a person's age. They were a government birth record, a church record and a statement by a close family member.          The Akea study has produced two major findings. The first is Sardinia's extremely high number of centenarians. The island had about 135 centenarians for every one million people. In other Western countries, the average is about seventy five centenarians for every one million people. The second major finding is an unusual rate of female to male centenarians. Sardinia has two women centenarians for every male centenarian. In central Sardinia there are equal numbers of female and male centenarians.          Studies in other parts of the world have shown a much higher percentage of female centenarians. The Akea study collected information about the health and diet of about 140 of the centenarians. About ninety percent of those in the study agreed to provide blood for scientific testing. The study team hope to identify genetic material in the blood that can be linked to successful aging. Study leaders say there is no single reason why people on Sardinia live so long. They believe the answer is a combination of genetic and environmental conditions. What is the passage mainly about?\nA.Why people on Sardinia live so long.\nB.The world's oldest woman.\nC.The world's oldest man.\nD.A scientific study on centenarians.\nAnswer:",

And by 1992, as head of the Microsoft company, he became the richest man in America with assets of nearly US $ 6.3 billion. Born in Seattle, Washington on 28, October, 1956, Gates was named William Henry after his father and grandfather. From the beginning, he was an extremely energetic and intelligent child. He had read the entire world book encyclopedia by the age of nine. His favorite subjects at school were science and math and his favorite pastime was \"thinking\". Gates first started to play with computers at the age of 13. Before long he became an expert at working the school's computer. After his graduation from secondary school, Gates was accepted by the three top universities in the USA-Princeton, Harvard and Yale. He chose Harvard and began classes there the next autunm, majoring maths. But he was still obsessed with computers and spent as much time in the computer laboratories as he did in the lecture halls. By 1975, Gates and a partner, Paul Allen, had developed a software program called BASIC. This was not the first program ever created, but its inventors were the first to decide that people who wanted to use it should pay for it. BASIC was a success because until it came along, there had been no efficient way of getting computers to carry out instructions. Although he had not completed his degree, Gates left university and went to work full time for the new company he had formed called Microsoft. His next project was the software program that made him famous and very rich. It was called DOS, short for Disk Operating System, and it was purchased by IBM in 1980. Today it is the operating system used in more than 14 million personal computers around the world. As chief executive officer of Microsoft, Gates is known as a bright man, but one who is not easily satisfied. He is quick to criticize his staff and hates to be questioned about decisions he has made. He was regarded as a loner and unfashionable boring computer nut until his marriage to Microsoft manager Melinda French on New Year's Day 1994. Yet to many people now, Gates, is a person who is, in spite of his great wealth, humble and ordinary. He spends his money carefully. He eats in fast food restaurants and flies economy class.

He was John Styth Pemberton, born in 1833 in Knoxville, Georgia, eighty miles away. Pemberton was a chemist, sometimes known as Doctor, who, during the Civil War, became an officer and led a cavalry troop. He settled in Atlanta in 1869, and soon began making such patent medicines as Triplex Liver Pills and Globe of Flower Cough Syrup. In 1885, he registered a trademark for something called French Wine Coca-Ideal Nerve and Tonic Stimulant. A few months later, he formed the Pemberton Chemical Company, and hired an accountant named Frank M. Robinson, who had not only a good head for figures, but, attached to it, so unique a nose that he could judge the ingredients of a batch of syrup merely by sniffing it. In 1886 --- a year in which, as contemporary Coca-Cola officials like to point out, the English writer Conan Doyle made Sherlock Holmes known publicly and France found the truth about the Statue of Liberty --- Pemberton invented a syrup that he called Coca-Cola. It was a change of his French Wine Coca. He had taken out the wine and added a bit of caffeine, and, when the end product tasted awful, had thrown in some cola nut oil and a few other oils, mixing the mixture in a three-legged iron pot in his back yard and swishing it around with an oar. He distributed it to soda fountains in used beer bottles, and Robinson, with his elegant account's script, instantly designed a label, on which \"Coca-Cola\" was written in the style which is still employed. Pemberton looked upon his mixture less as a drink than as a headache cure. One morning in 1886, a man suffering from a headache dragged himself into an Atlanta drugstore and asked for a bottle of Coca-Cola. According to usual practice, druggists should pour a teaspoonful of syrup into a glass of water, but at that time, the man on duty was too lazy to walk to the fresh-water tap. Instead, he mixed the syrup with some soda water, which was closer at hand. After drinking it, the suffering customer cheered up almost at once, and word quickly spread that the best Coca-Cola was a fizzy  one. How did Pemberton change French Wine Coca formula to make it taste delicious?\nA.He mixed it with several oils instead of water.\nB.He put some beer into the mixture.\nC.He added more coffee into the mixture than before.\nD.He added some cola nut oil and a few other oils.\nAnswer:",

Yet the dark part of the moon's surface is not  ly black; generally it is just light enough for us to be able to see its outline, so that we speak of seeing \"the old moon in the new moon's arms.\" The light by which we see the old moon does not come from the sun, but from the earth. We know well how the surface of the sea or of snow, or even of a wet road, may throw back uncomfortably much of the sun's light onto our faces. In the same way the surface of the whole earth throws back enough of the sun's light on to the face of the moon for us to be able to see the parts of it which would otherwise be dark. By \"saying the old moon in the new moon's arms\", we mean a time when_.\nA.the two moon's are closely linked\nB.the new moon is at its brightest\nC.the moon is partly bright and partly dark\nD.the new moon is hugging the old moon\nAnswer:",

In autumn, the forests in Siberia are full of mushrooms and berries . Many people like picking mushrooms, but that is not as simple as you might think. Old people who live in the villages know places where you can pick lots of mushrooms. Some mushrooms grow in colonies. If you find one, you only need to look around because nearby you'll find more of them. However, when picking mushrooms, it is important not to choose the wrong kind. You have to be careful because some mushrooms are poisonous even though they look good. The smell can help you choose them, because good mushrooms smell very good. Siberian people are very friendly and hospitable. If someone invites you home for dinner, you'll soon be full. You should try everything the host is having. The climate there depends on the territory. Some places have very comfortable climates with hot summers and cold winters. In my opinion, the best season is spring, when nature wakes up after a long winter. It is the time for blossoms and love. Birds come back from other warm countries. Trees become dressed in green. The sun becomes warm and the days are longer. The mood is wonderful and people smile a lot. It is an amazing time. In winter, you have opportunity for sports.

It was to be performed on a twenty-one week old fetus in uterus at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. At that time, in 1999, twenty-one weeks in uterus was the earliest that the surgical team would consider for surgery. The worst possible outcome would be that the surgery would cause premature delivery, and no child born earlier than twenty-three weeks had survived. The tension could be felt in the operating room as the surgery began. A typical C-section cut was made to access the uterus, which was then lifted out and laid at the junction of the mother's thighs . The entire procedure would take place within the uterus, and no part of the child was to breach the surgical opening. During the procedure, the position of the fetus was adjusted by gently moving the outside of the uterus. The entire surgical procedure on the child was completed in one hour and thirteen minutes. When it was over, the surgical team breathed a sigh of relief, as did I. As a doctor asked me what speed of film I was using, out of the corner of my eye I saw the uterus shake, but no one's hands were near it. _ was shaking from within. Suddenly, an entire arm thrust out of the opening, then pulled back until just a little hand was showing. The doctor reached over and lifted the hand, which reacted and squeezed the doctor's finger.

In this city, drivers searching for parking spots lead to 30 percent of all downtown jams, city officials think.Now San Francisco has found a solution -- a phone app for spot-seekers that shows information about areas with available spaces.The system, introduced last month, relies on wireless sensors fixed in streets and city garages that can tell within seconds if a spot has opened up. But the system could come with serious consequences.Some people say that drivers searching for parking could end up focusing on their phones, not the road.\"It could be really distracting ,\" said Daniel Simons, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois. City officials admitted the hidden problem.They are urging drivers to pull over before they use the city's iPhone app, or to do so before they leave home. Nathaniel Ford, executive director of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, said safety could actually improve if drivers quickly found a spot instead of circling and getting frustrated. San Francisco has put sensors into 7,000 parking spots and 12,250 spots in city garages.If spaces in an area open up, the sensors communicate wirelessly with computers that in turn make the information available to app users within a minute, said Mr. Ford, of the transportation agency.On the app, a map shows which blocks have lots of places(blue)and which are full(red).

The book wasn't very interesting, but between its pages there was something very interesting indeed. It was a thin strip of vellum on which was written the secret of the \"Touchstone\"! The touchstone was a small pebble that could turn any common metal into pure gold. The writing explained that it was lying among thousands and thousands of other pebbles that looked exactly like it. But the secret was this: The real stone would feel warm, while ordinary pebbles are cold. So the man sold his few belongings, bought some simple supplies, camped on the seashore, and began testing pebbles. He knew that if he picked up ordinary pebbles and threw them down again because they were cold, he might pick up the same pebble hundreds of times. So, when he felt one that was cold, he threw it into the sea. He spent a whole day doing this but none of them was the touchstone. Yet he went on and on this way. Pick up a pebble. Cold, throw it into the sea. Pick up another. Throw it into the sea. Pick up another. Throw it into the sea. The days continued over a long period of time. One day, however, about mid-afternoon, he picked up a pebble and it was warm. He threw it into the sea before he realized what he had done. He had formed such a strong habit of throwing each pebble into the sea that when the one he wanted came along he still threw it away. So it is with opportunity.

Also, if we don't find new kinds of energy, we will use up all the fossil fuels in the twenty-first century. Scientists are working hard to find other kinds of energy for the future. What might these sources of energy be? Energy from the wind All over the world, people use the power of the wind. It turns windmills and moves sailboats. It is a clean source of energy, and there is lots of it. Unfortunately, if the wind does not blow, there is no wind energy. Energy from water When water moves from a high place to a lower place, it makes energy. This energy is used to create electricity. In Brittany, France, for example, waterpower produces enough energy to light a town of 40,000people. Waterpower gives energy without pollution. However, people have to build dams to use this energy. Dams cost a lot of money, so water energy is expensive. Energy from the earth There is heat in rocks under the earth. Scientists use this heat to make geothermal energy. San Francisco gets half of the energy it needs from geothermal power. This kind of energy is cheap, but it is possible only in a few places in the world.

        "input":"A metaphor is a poetic device that deals with comparison. It compares similar qualities of two dissimilar objects. With a simple metaphor, one object becomes the other: Love is a rose. Although this does not sound like a particularly rich image, a metaphor can communicate so much about a particular image that poets use them more than any other type of figurative language. The reason for this is that poets compose their poetry to express what they are experiencing emotionally at that moment. Consequently, what the poet imagines love to be may or may not be our understanding of love. Therefore, the poet's job is to enable us to experience it, to feel it the same way as the poet does. Let's analyze this remarkably simple metaphor concerning love and the rose to see what it offers. Because the poet uses a comparison with a rose, first we must examine the characteristics of that flower. A rose is impressive in its beauty, its petals are nicely soft, and its smell is pleasing. It's possible to say that a rose is actually a feast to the senses of sight, touch, and smell. The rose's appearance seems to border on perfection, each petal seemingly equal in form. Isn't this the way one's love should be?A loved one should be a delight to one's senses and seem perfect. However, there is another dimension added to the comparison by using a rose. Roses have thorns. The poet wants to convey the idea that roses can be tricky. So can love, the metaphor tells us. When one reaches out with absolute trust to touch the object of his or her affection, ouch, a thorn can cause great harm! \"Be careful,\" the metaphor warns, \"Love is a feast to the senses, but it can overwhelm us, and it can also hurt us and cause acute suffering.\" This is the poet's understanding of love--an admonition  . What is the point?Just this: It took almost 14 sentences to clarify what a simple metaphor communicates in only four words! That is the artistry and the joy of the simple metaphor. According to the passage, a metaphor is a   _  .\nA.description of two similar objects in a poetic way\nB.literary device specially employed in poetry writing\nC.contrast between two different things to create a vivid image\nD.comparison between two different objects with similar features\nAnswer:",

An analysis of eight previous studies by University of Cambridge researchers found that for each additional hour spent outside per week, the risk of short-sightedness was reduced by 2%.They said exposure to natural light and time spent looking at distant objects could be key factors .    The studies involved more than 10,000 children and adolescents. Dr Justin Sherwin and his research team concluded that short-sighted children spent an average of 3.7 fewer hours per week outdoors than those who either had normal vision or were far-sighted.    But they said the reasons were not yet clear.They expected to find that children who spent more time outdoors also spent less time doing activities like reading, studying or playing computer games, but no such link was found in two of the eight studies which looked at this relationship.    However, Dr Sherwin said they would now need more precise data to try to understand which factors,  such as increased use of distance vision, reduced use of near vision, natural ultraviolet  light exposure  and physical activity,are most important.    \"Any increase in time spent outdoors must be weighed against exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the increased risk of skin cancer, cataracts and other cancers.\"he said.\"On the other hand, increasing outdoor physical activity could protect against diabetes and obesity, for example.\"     Short-sightedness is a common eye condition that causes distant objects to appear blurred , while close objects can be seen clearly.

Most physicians have a contract relationship with one or more hospitals in the community. They send their patients to this hospital, which usually charges patients according to the number of days they stay and the facilities(operating room, tests, medicines that they use). Some hospitals belong to a city, a state or, in the case of veteran's hospitals, a federal government agency. Others are operated by religious orders  or other non-profit groups. Some medical doctors are on salary. Salaried physicians may work as hospital staff members, or residents, who are often still in training. They may teach in medical schools, be hired by corporations to care for their workers or work for the federal government's Public Health Service. Physicians are among the best paid professionals in the United States. In the 1980s, it was not uncommon for medical doctors to earn incomes of more than $ 100 000 a year. Specialists, particularly surgeons, might earn several times that amount. Physicians list many reasons why they deserve to be so well rewarded for their work. One reason is the long and expensive preparation required to become a physician in the United States. Most would be physicians first attend college for four years, which can cost nearly $ 20 000 a year at one of the best private institutions. Prospective physicians then attend medical school for four years. Tuition alone can exceed $ 10 000 a year. By the time they have obtained their medical degrees, many young physicians are deeply in debt. They still face three to five years of residency  in a hospital, the first year as an apprentice physician. The hours are long and the pay is relatively low. Setting up a medical practice is expensive, too. Sometimes several physicians will decide to establish a group practice, so they can share the expense of maintaining an office and buying equipment. These physicians also take care of each other's patients in emergencies. Physicians work long hours and must accept a great deal of responsibility.

In ancient Rome, when the emperor wanted to spare someone's life, he would put his thumb up. Today in the United States, when someone puts his \/ her thumb up, it means \"Everything is all right\". However, in Sardinia and Greece, the gesture is insulting and should not be used there. In the United States, raising your clasped hands above your head means \"I'm the champion\" or \"I'm the winner\". It is the sign prizefighters make when they win a fight. When a leading Russian statesman  made this gesture after a White House meeting, Americans misunderstood and thought he meant he was a winner. In Russia, however, it is a sign of friendship. In the United States, holding your hand up with the thumb and index finger in a circle and the other three fingers spread out means \"Everything is O.K.\" and is frequently used by astronauts and politicians. In France and Belgium, it can mean \"You're worth nothing.\" There are other nonverbal signals that people should be aware of when they go to another country, such as the distance to maintain between speakers. Americans usually feel comfortable when speaking with someone if the distance between them is about eighteen inches to arm's length. Anything closer makes them feel uncomfortable. When talking to Americans, it is also important to make eye contact. If you look down when talking to an American, he \/ she may feel that you are embarrassed, afraid, or trying to hide something. In addition to knowing how to communicate nonverbally in a country, it is important to know what you and he cannot discuss. In the United States, there are certain topics to avoid when you first meet someone, For example, don't ask people their age, weight, religion, marital status , how much money they earn, or how much something costs. You can talk about work, the weather, traffic problems, sports, food, news of the day, where one lives, consumer subjects (computers, car repairs, and so forth), and travel or vacation plans. These few examples illustrate that your actions can speak louder than your words. In a particular cultural contest, what you say and what you don't say are equally important. As we can see from the passage there are   _   kinds of nonverbal communication signals.\nA.four\nB.five\nC.six\nD.seven\nAnswer:",

Many parents have offered cash to their children in the hope that it would improve marks and possibly raise their children's interest in achieving higher marks. The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Toronto (UT) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to learn more about the potential for financial encouragement as motivation for improved marks, involved first and second year students receiving financial aid in 2008-2009 at the University of Toronto Scarborough. The top students participating in the study who said they were \"very concerned\" about having enough money to complete their degrees were to receive $100 for getting a grade of 70 per cent for each one-semester course, plus $20 for every percentage point beyond that.It was imaginable that a student could earn as much as $700 for achieving 100 percent in a course. Harvey Weingarten, president and CEO of HEQCO said, \"In its efforts to help disadvantaged students by exploring the idea of paying them to attend school, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is asking the same question many other districts are asking about how to improve student participation and performance.Our study and others to date indicate that has little effect if any in those situations where it has been tested.\" The authors of the study suggest that ineffective study habits may be a barrier to academic achievement and that the real problem may be more a lack of academic preparation than a lack of effort or motivation.They note that the availability of peer   advising does not appear to have helped greatly.They conclude that other potential avenues to improving performance, or other approaches of teaching, are needed at the high school and postsecondary levels.

He was very tired, sick and lost. He had no food, water or shelter . Mortenson reached a poor village called Korphe in the Karakoram mountains of Pakistan.

        "input":"In Germany, English expressions are used in conversations and increasingly in written form. Advertisements are often expressed completely in English. When I go to the gym, there are \"aerobic-classes  \". We \"warm up\". We go \"jogging.\" In business, we attend a \"meeting\" and we have \"good connections.\" Other nations, like France, have taken action to protect their language from the influence of \"Americanization\". In Germany, however, there is concern that those rules could be connected with Hitler's Third Reich  , when the language had to be pure. If the government curbed the use of English words now, this could be considered by some as a return to that terrible past. Some German citizens are now trying to stop the use of English vocabulary in German. However, I think generally it is not a big deal to use some common English expressions as they often describe things more directly. But we should know that it is important to use English correctly. All too often, bad English is spoken or even written instead of good German. The proper use of the German language would be the better choice. However, there are some fields that require the use of English words, for example, in the high-tech communication and the Internet fields, there is no alternative to English. Also, I think sometimes I have to speak English when I introduce some scenic places to tourists. I think you have to find a balance and decide when it is better to use good German in place of bad English or when the use of correct English words is more suitable. Languages have always changed naturally, and I disagree with a restriction by law. Some nice expressions borrowed from other languages can make a conversation more vivid.

However, according to the International Energy Agency and the World Bank, more than a billion people in the world still do not have access to electricity. After sunset, most of them use candles or oil lamps. A company in the Netherlands is trying to change that with its products based on LEDs. When darkness falls, many kids in rural parts of Haiti, Rwanda, or refugee camps in Syria read or do their homework by candlelight or a kerosene -burning lamp. The open flames sometimes cause fires, while poisonous gases lead to respiratory problems. Portable electric light is safer, healthier and now, even cheaper. \"This is the first time that artificial light or solar LED is now less expensive than kerosene,\" said Camille van Gestel, head of a Dutch company called WakaWaka, over Skype. He added WakaWaka, which means \"Shine Bright\" in Swahili, is the most efficient solar-powered light and phone charger in the world today. When fully charged, it shines for up to 16 hours. It is affordable, sustainable, and its battery lasts for a long time. It can be set up on any flat surface, hung from a ceiling or set on top of a glass bottle. Van Gestel said his company operates like any other business, but some of the money made from selling its products is used to make WakaWaka lights affordable to poor people. He said the plan is supported by international non-government organizations. \"The International Rescue Committee was one of the first to actually take the WakaWaka power into Syria, to provide light and power for Syrian refugees, and now the WakaWaka is the most valued non-food item in Syria,\" said Van Gestel. In the past 24 months, the company has distributed around 300,000 units in places such as Syria, Hati, Rwanda, Indonesia and the Philippines. Its goal is to reach 1.2 billion people by 2030.

I took off my nursing shoes, relaxed and then said goodnight to the rest of the girls and headed out of the door. It was so cold and I could see the ice crystals in the air. As I approached my car, I saw one of my coworkers standing by the bus stop. I thought it would only take a couple of extra minutes to give her a ride home, and besides, it was too cold to be standing outside on the coldest night in January.

They look so much alike that they could be brother and sister. Do you believe that people who live together for many years would look alike? It's strange. but scientists say it's true. How scientists proved it? In a study, scientists found young couples only showed similarity by chance. However, elder couples were very likely to look like each other. The similarity could be very subtle  and could be found in wrinkles  or furrows, etc. Besides, some couples look far more alike than other couples. The scientists thought of several possible reasons: 1. Diet. \"We are what we eat.\" As couples usually share the same diet, will they probably look alike? For example, if both partners eat a high fat diet, their faces will tend to look fat. However, the scientists ruled this out  using another small study. 2. Environment. Will elderly couples show similarity because they live together in the same area for a long time? The environmental factors  such as sunshine and wind affect the skin in similar ways. The scientists ruled this possibility out as well. 3. Empathy . This is the theory  the scientists believe in. Couples grow to look similar because they are empathizing with each other.

Phillips, who works in China, released his report saying China's suicide rate from 1995 to 1999 reached 0.023 percent, the country has been ranked among those with the highest suicide rates in the world. But Jing Jun, a professor of sociology in Tsinghua University, challenges that view and presents the true picture through his nationwide research. Jing and his students took one year to set up the first national database on suicide rate to grasp the overall trend of suicides in China. They collected data from the Health Statistics Annuals of the World Health Organization (sample size 10 million), and the country's Health Statistics Annuals (which cover 100 million people). The database covers 23 years, from 1987 to 2009. Jing calculates the suicide rate in China based on these data. Though the suicide rate was comparatively high in the early years, his study shows it has dropped in recent years, as opposed to the ascending trend in the rest of the world. According to Jing's calculation, China's suicide rate had dropped to about 0.01 percent in 2004. In 2009, the figure dropped further to 0.007 percent, which is rather low compared with the global rate of 0.016 percent. Even if the \"missing\" suicides were added, China's suicide rate in 2009 would still be below 0.008 percent.[:Zxxk.Com] Jing has found that one of the main reasons why the suicide rate has dropped was the steady and big decline in the number of suicides committed by rural women. In the early years, researchers generally agreed that the suicide rate among Chinese women was higher than among men, which is pretty rare in the rest the world. But the suicide rate among Chinese women, especially in rural areas, has declined remarkably in recent years. In fact, it is almost equal to that of Chinese men. As a sociologist, Jing regards suicide as a social issue, and believes improvement of social policies will reduce the suicide rate even further. More people's lives can be saved if the authorities adjust to social environment for the better, he concludes. The data in Para. 2 is mainly to prove that   _  .\nA.the result from Jing's research is believable\nB.Jing's research is more complicated than Michael R.

Conwy's Town Walls Conwy's Town Walls are an ancient defensive   project around the town of Conwy in North Wales. The walls were built between 1283 and 1287. They are 1.3 kilometers long and include 21 towers and three gate houses. The project was completed by large quantities of workers and cost around PS15,000. Today the walls form part of the UNESCO world heritage site .

Recently a friend sent me a copy of an email she received from the customer service department of her credit card company,after she contacted them with a question about her account. She was happy with their positive response. But as I read the email,one line jumped out at me:\"In lieu of good customer service...\" Did they really mean they were offering her a few extra reward points instead of good customer service?I doubt it. More likely,what the customer service department meant to say was,\"Because good customer service is important to us...\" followed by the details of what they were doing to make sure she remained a happy customer. So why didn't the writer say that?I can only guess that perhaps the writer liked the phrase \"in lieu of\",thought it sounded more interesting than saying \"because\",and so used it--without bothering to check the true meaning.

The attack destroyed one of the world's highest skyscrapers and left 5,000 people dead or missing. Movie fans have become used to such events after years of Hollywood films showing disasters, terrorism and danger. The Empire State Building, the White House, New York City and even the American president himself have all been threatened  by terrorist attacks in these exciting films. The film\" True Lies\", released in 1994, is considered to be a good example of this kind of movie. The special effects, including explosions and missiles, make the action look like a real thing. \"Independence Day\" in 1996 took this type of movie one step further by blowing up the White House. This science fiction  movie is about a war between human beings and aliens from another planet. In the movie, the World Trade Center towers are destroyed. Violence has become a major part of Hollywood movies. And this is what people enjoy. Soon after the attacks, many famous film companies stopped the planned releases of some of their new movies, especially if their films showed terrorist attacks or plane crashes. \"Swordfish\" was top of the American box office in June. But the movie's story was frighteningly similar to the Sept. 11 disaster. The film would have been stopped in American and British cinemas after the attack.

But what about local bike shops ? Is City Bike booming at their expense? At Gotham Bikes in Tribeca, a manager who gave his name as \"Ben W.\" said the shop has seen an increase in its overall sales due to the bike-share program. \"It's getting more people on the road, more people learning about the sport and getting involved,\" he said. An employee at Danny's Cycles in Gramercy said Citi Bike is a good option for people in a city famed for its traffic jams and aggressive drivers. \"They can try out a bike without buying one:' James Ryan said. Rentals are not a big part of the business at either Gotham Bikes or Danny's Cycles. But for Frank's Bike Shop, a small business on Grand St., the bike-share program has been bad news. Owner Frank Arroyo said that his rental business has decreased by 90% since Citi Bike was launched last month. Arroyo's main rental customers are European tourists, who have since been drawn away by Citi Bikes. However, Ben said the bike-share is good for bike sales at his shop. \"People have used the bike-share and realized how great it is to bike in the city, then decide that they want something nicer for themselves,\" he noted. Christian Farrell of Waterfront Bicycle Shop, on West St. said at first he was concerned about bike-share, though, he admitted, \"I was happy to see people on bikes.\" Farrell's early concerns were repeated by Andrew Crooks, owner of NYC Velo, at 64 Second Ave. \"It seemed like a great idea, but one that would be difficult to put into use:' Crooks said of Citi Bike. He said he worried about inexperienced riders' lack of awareness of biking rules and strong negative reaction from non-cyclists. However, he said, it's still too early to tell if his business has been impacted   . While it's possible bike-share will cause a drop in business, Crooks agreed that the idea is a positive step forward for New York City.

Many of passers-by slowed down their paces and put some money into the hat of the young man. The next day, at the same place, he put his hat on the ground gracefully. Different than the day before, he took out a large piece of paper and laid it on the ground and put some stones on it. Then he adjusted the violin and began playing. It seemed more pleasant to listen to. The words read, \"Last night, a gentleman named George Sang put an important thing into my hat mistakenly. Please come to claim it soon.\" Seeing this, people wondered what it could be. After about half an hour, a middle-aged man ran there hurriedly and rushed through the crowd to the violinist and grabbed his shoulders and said, \"Yes, it's you. You did come here.

It's lottery.\" \"Is it?\" The violinist took out a lottery ticket and asked. George nodded promptly and seized the lottery ticket and kissed it, then he danced with the violinist. The story turned out to be this: George Sang bought a lottery ticket, winning a prize of $500,000. After work, he passed the station and felt the music was so wonderful that he took out 50 dollars and put it in the hat. However, the lottery ticket was also thrown in. The violinist was a student at an Arts College and had planned to attend further study in Vienna. He had booked the ticket and would fly that morning. However when he was cleaning up he found the lottery ticket. Thinking that the owner would return to look for it, he cancelled the flight and came back to where he was given the lottery ticket.

Fellow students in the classroom know a paper that has several red markings on it will usually receive a lower grade. The child with many red markings on his test will quickly fold the paper and stuff it into his desk in the hope that no one will see his test. There is an education movement to retire the reds for softer color1s of purple, green, and blue pens to mark students' work. Many educators understand the psychological harm the constant red markings on the paper do to a child's self-esteem. After a child receives his test back with countless red markings there is a rare chance that he will bother to find out his errors. It is too embarrassing in the classroom to examine his errors and also many children do not want to show their parents their red stained test. The purpose of grading a paper or test is to identify the child's weakness and offer suggestions to improve their ability in a specific subject. Red markings are too   for the student to calmly understand their errors ; instead they become upset and begin their self-critical dialogue. No student wants to fail; they just do not know how to excel. All color1s have an influence on our state of mind. Red is a powerful color1 that gives us energy. Colors such as blues and greens are calming color1s to the body. Hospitals often have doctors wear blue or green scrubs because it relaxes the patient on a subconscious level.

        "input":"Parents can usually tell if their children are lying to them, and so can teachers. Knowing if someone is lying can be useful. There are a number of behaviors that you can observe to help catch someone in a lie. Eyes, windows to the soul, can provide information about whether you are hearing the truth or a lie. Here is a simple experiment. Ask a friend or a family member to imagine their mother with green hair. You should notice that their eyes look up to their left while they are imagining their mother. Then ask them to think about what they did this morning and their eyes will probably look up to the right. Basically, eye movement to the left indicates the person is imagining something that is not real or did not happen. When the eyes move up and to the right, the person is remembering something that actually happened. Body language is another way to see if someone is telling tales. A professional poker   player will probably tell you not to believe someone whose hands touch their face, throat, or mouth. It seems that when we are being less than truthful our hands want to cover our face in some way. It is unlikely that a liar (someone who tells lies) will touch their chest with an open hand. Paying careful attention to how people talk can also help you catch someone in a lie. If a student is accused of copying homework, and is guilty, they are likely to get defensive. They may deny the copying and ask why the teacher does not like him or her, while an innocent person might be expected to take the offensive, explaining for example, how they got the ideas for the homework and convincing the teacher to talk to someone who saw them do the homework. You may also find a guilty person speaks more than is natural and adds lots of unnecessary details to their story in an attempt to convince you they are telling the truth. If you suspect this is happening, try changing the subject of your conversation quickly. A liar will happily follow your change of direction and will become more relaxed. But remember: just because someone is showing one or more of the signs associated with lying does not necessarily make them a liar. Some other forms of stress other than lying may explain their behavior, and some people exhibit these signs as normal behavior. However, if you need to distinguish a lie from the truth, these tips could be a good start.

Of course, you're a learned person who doesn't believe in such things. But scientists now say that it might not all be superstition  . Researchers from Semmelweis University in Hungary recently asked 366 university students to fill out a questionnaire. The answers given included things like \"My mood often changes for no reason\", \"I love to deal with new projects, even if they're risky \", and \"I complain a lot\". They then compared students' answers to their birthdays. They found that the season of your birth may have some effect on who you are. Researchers found that people born in the summer were more likely to quickly change between sad and happy emotions. People born in the winter, however, were less likely to become angry. Spring birthdays were more likely to make people overly positive, while people born in autumn were less likely to be depressive  . So, why could the seasons cause such differences? \"Biochemical studies have shown that the season in which you are born affects some monoamine neurotransmitters  ,\" lead researcher Xenia Gonda said in a written statement. \"This led us to believe that birth season may have a longer-lasting effect.\" Monoamine neurotransmitters are given off from neurones  . They affect our emotions. So the researchers believe they might have an effect on the development of our personalities. Different seasons also have different food and nutrients   to offer. In addition, mothers usually get more physical exercise and enjoy more sunlight in warm seasons than in cold seasons. All these are \"environmental factors \" which may influence a person's personality, said Gonda. But the research only included a survey and didn't follow participants over time. More research is needed before a final answer can be given on the connection between season and personality. Don't worry, though. Even if the connection is proven, it won't mean that your birth month completely decides who you are. Being happy or sad is up to you. The study from Semmelweis University in Hungary intended to prove that   _  .\nA.a person's birth season might affect their monoamine neurotransmitters\nB.monoamine neurotransmitters might be connected to our emotions\nC.people's personalities might depend on environmental factors\nD.the season of a person's birthday may affect their personality\nAnswer:",

Several times I got stuck behind a slow-moving truck on a narrow road with a solid white line on my left, and I became increasingly impatient. At one point along an open road, I came to a crossing with a traffic light. I was alone on the road by now, but as I drove near the light, it turned red and I made a stop. I looked left, right and behind me. Nothing. Not a car, no suggestion of car lamps, but there I sat, waiting for the light to change, the only human being for at least a mile in any direction. I started wondering why I refused to run the light I was not afraid of being caught, because there was clearly no policeman around, and there certainly would have been no danger in going through it. Much later that night, the question of why I'd stopped for that light came back to me. I think I stopped because it's part of a contract we all have with each other. It's not only the law, but it is an agreement we have, and we trust each other to honor it: we don't go through red lights.

What's even more impressive is that the young bankers and their 90,004---clients are all homeless! The Children's Development Khazana (treasure) opened its first branch in 2001 at a homeless shelter in New Deli as a way to help the street children protect their hard-earned money from thieves. Since then, the idea has caught on like wildfire. Today, Khazana has 12 branches all across New Deli, with a total of Rupees 12lakh (about 22,000USD) in deposits. Not only that, there are now 77 affiliated branches in other parts of Asia, ranging from Nepal, Bangladesh and Afghanistan to the island of Sri Lanka, and even Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia. While no deposit or balance is too small for the bank, they do have strict regulations about where the money is earned from. Funds obtained by begging or selling drugs are not welcomed at this bank ! Also, unlike the real banks, all employees are volunteers, which means that they go to school or a paying job during the day and work at the bank in the evening. To ensure that everybody gets a chance to participate in running the branch, two volunteer managers are elected from the clients base every six months. Karan, the current manager is just 14-year-old. During the day he earns a living by helping out the cleaning crew at wedding banquets and other big parties. In the evening, he handles the deposits and withdrawals in the bank. After the bank closes, he along with an adult volunteer from the shelter head over to a regular bank and deposit the funds collected into Khazana's interest-bearing bank account and though it started with one single purpose.

But as Tom Cruise, playing Lt. Daniel Kaffee in the movie A Few Good Men, said, \"I get sick when I fly because I'm afraid of crashing into a large mountain. I don't think Daniel will help.\" But there's a new application that just may. Today, the VALK Foundation, a Dutch group that's a partnership between KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and the University of Leiden, launches the app in the US. The VALK Foundation was one of the first centers for research and fear-of-flying treatment in the world and is the organizer of three world conferences on fear of flying.The foundation said the app, called Flight App VALK, is the first scientifically-developed, web-based treatment for people who suffer from mild to moderate fear of flying. \"The fear of flying application we have created aims to transfer all of the knowledge we have developed through our program into a mobile application that will help ease travelers' fears,\" said Dr. Lucas van Gerwen, director of the VALK Foundation. Dr. van Gerwen is also a psychologist and professional pilot with more than 30 years experience. The foundation said up to 30% of adults are fearful fliers. The Flight App is designed to help relax passengers before and during flights by educating users about flight safety and turbulence. It explains the sounds and sensations they can expect during departure, flight and landing. And, if a passenger's flight stress reaches a panic level, they press a special panic button which provides audio and written information to help decrease stress levels. Most importantly, the Flight App can be used during the flight in the airplane mode. Once downloaded, the program does not require Internet connection in the air.

She looked bored as she followed her friends Suki and Jill out of the store, but inside she felt panicked.  \"I can't believe you made me do that,\" Leah cried. ks5u \"Relax,\" said Jill. \"Everybody does it sometimes. And we didn't make you do it. \" She said nothing, but Leah knew she wouldn't have done that on her own. She was just experiencing huge peer  pressure.  Sometimes, though, the stresses in your life can actually come from your peers. They may pressure you into doing something you're uncomfortable with, such as shoplifting, doing drugs or drinking, or taking dangerous risks when driving a car.  The pressure to conform (to do what others are doing) can be powerful and hard to resist. A person might feel pressure to do something just because others are doing it. Peer pressure can influence a person to do something that is  ly harmless -- or something that has more serious consequences. Giving in to the pressure to dress a certain way is one thing -- going along with the crowd to drink or smoke is another.  The people who are most easily influenced will follow someone else's lead first. Then others may go along, too -- so it can be easy to think, \"It must be OK. Everyone else is doing it. They must know what they're doing. \"Before you know it, many people are going along with the crowd -- perhaps on something they might not otherwise do.  Responding to peer pressure is part of human nature -- but some people are more likely to give in, and others are better able to resist and stand their ground. People who are low on confidence and those who tend to follow rather than lead could be more likely to seek their peers' approval by giving in to a risky challenge or suggestion. People who are unsure of themselves, new to the group, or inexperienced with peer pressure may also be more likely to give in.

Copying is also suggested as a means by which parents can have the child of their dreams.Couples might choose to have a copy of a film star,baseball player or scientist,depending on their interest.But because personality is only partly the result of genetic inheritance ,conflicts would be sure to arise if the cloned child failed to develop the same interest as the original.What if the copy of Einstein shows no interest in science?Or the baseball player turns to acting?Success also depends upon fortune.What if the child does not live up to the hopes and dreams of the parents simply because of bad luck? Every child should be wanted for itself,as an individual.In making a copy of oneself or some famous person,a parent is deliberately specifying the way he or she wishes that child to develop.In recent years,particularly in the U.S.,much importance has been placed on the right of individuals to reproduce in ways that they wish.So I suggest there is a greater need to consider the interest of the child and to reject these proposed uses of cloning.

Teachers are dealing with exhausted kids in the classroom. It's a very serious problem. Many children attend after-school clubs by necessity. But competitive pressures also create an explosion of activities. They include sports, language, music and math classes for children as young as four. \"There is a new parenting trend  under way which says that you have to tap all your child's potential  at a young age; otherwise you will let him down,\" says Terry Apter, a Cambridge-based child and adolescent psychiatrist . \"It isn't entirely new: there have always been pushy parents.

The concept is being used to deal with one possibly dangerous form of waste - electronic junk  , such as old computers, cell-phones, and televisions. But this process for managing e-waste may be used in an unscrupulous way more often than not used, a recent report suggests. \"A lot of these materials are being sent to developing nations under the excuse of reuse - to bridge the digital divide,\" said Richard Gutierrez, a policy researcher. One of the problems is that no one proves whether these old machines work before they hit the seaways. Because of this, the report says, e-waste is a growing problem in Lagos, Nigeria, and elsewhere in the developing world. Much of the waste ends up being thrown away along rivers and roads. Often it's picked apart by poor people, who may face dangerous exposure to poisonous chemicals in the equipment. Businessmen also pay workers a little money to get back materials such as gold and copper. This low-tech recovery process could expose workers and the local environment to many dangerous materials used to build electronics. According to Gutierrez, this shadow economy exists because the excuse of recycling and reusing electronics gives businessmen \"a green passport\" to ship waste around the globe. \"Developing nations must take upon some of the responsibility themselves,\" Gutierrez said. But, he added, \"A greater portion of this responsibility should fall on the exporting state.\" China, for example, has become a dumping place for large amounts of e-waste. The nation is beginning to take action to stop the flow of dangerous materials across its borders. The Chinese government, after many years of denial, is finally beginning to take the lead.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit- hole under the bush. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? \"I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?\" she said aloud. \"I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think. I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward!

        "input":"Language is a major problem for the European Union (EU). The agreement or treaty  which created the organization that eventually became the EU, the Treaty of Rome, stated that each country's language must be treated equally. The original  six countries had only three languages between them: French, German and Dutch\/Flemish. However, there are now 15 countries in the EU, with a total of 12 languages. EU documents must be translated into all these languages, and at official meetings the speeches must be translated into all the languages by interpreters. All this translating is very expensive and time-consuming  . It is said that nearly half of all employees of the EU are engaged in translating documents and speeches, and nearly half of the EU's administrative  costs are spent on this task. In the near future it is probable that several more countries, most of them having their own languages, will join the EU, thus making the situation even worse. The problem is not just cost; there are practical difficulties as well. With 12 languages, there are 132 possible \"translation situations\" that might be needed. It is often difficult to find people in the right place at the right time who can translate from (for example) Danish into Greek, or Dutch into Portuguese, at a high professional standard. In practice the problem has been made less severe by the use of English in many contacts between EU officials, since almost all of them speak some English. However, any move to reduce the number of official languages (perhaps to four or five) would be a blow to the pride of the smaller Countries. Another commonly suggested solution is to make English the official language for all EU business. However, this is strongly resisted by powerful member countries like France and Germany.

The $386 million Phoenix Mars is planned to touch down in the Martian arctic in 2008. The stationary probe will use its robotic arm to dig into the icy land and pick up soil samples to analyze. In 2002, the Mars Odyssey orbiter spotted evidence of ice-rich soil near the arctic surface.  Scientists hope the Phoenix mission will find clues to the geologic history of water on the Red Planet and determine whether microbes existed in the ice. Phoenix will be the first mission of the Mars Scout program, a renewed, low-cost effort to study the Red Planet. \"The Phoenix mission explores new territory in the northern plains of Mars analogous to the permafrost regions on Earth,\" Peter Smith said.  True to its name, Phoenix rose from the ashes of previous missions. The lander for Phoenix was built to fly as part of the 2001 Mars Surveyor program. But the program broke down after the well-known disappearance of the Mars Polar Lander in 1999. The Polar Lander lost contact during a landing attempt near the planet's south pole after its rocket engine shut off  _ , causing the spacecraft to fall about 130 feet to almost certain destruction. The Phoenix probe had been in storage at a Lockheed Martin clean room in Denver before it was reused for its present mission.

        "input":"Most employers say that they wish to employ the right person for the right job. A recent report by Britain's Independent Institute of Manpower Studies, however, disagrees with this. The report states that most employers wish to avoid employing the wrong person. Rather than looking for the right person, they are looking for applicants to turn down. The report also suggests that in Britain and in many other parts of the world the selection methods used to pick out the right person for the job certainly do not match up to those used to judge a piece of new equipment. Employers used three main selection methods: interviewing, checking resume or application forms and examining references. Most of the employers asked in this survey stated that these selection methods were used more for weeding out unsuitable applicants rather than for finding suitable ones. Interviews were considered to be more reliable than either resume checks or references from past employers. Research, however, proves otherwise. Interviewers' decisions are often strongly influenced by their earlier judgment of the written application. Also different employers view facts differently. One may consider applicants who have frequently changed jobs as people with broad and useful experience. Another will see such applicants as unreliable and unlikely to stay for long in the new job. Some employers place great importance on academic qualifications whereas the link between this and success in management is not necessarily strong. Some employers use handwriting as a standard. The report states that there is little evidence to support the value of the letter for judging working ability. References, also, are sometimes unreliable as they are not very important while checks on credit and security records and applicants' political opinions are often the opposite. The report is more favorable towards trainability tests and those which test personality and personal and mental skills. The report concludes by suggesting that interviewing could become more reliable if the questions were arranged in a careful, organized system and focused on the needs of the employing organization.

They are doing a fine job educationally, but they are caught in a financial squeeze, with no way to reduce rising cost or increase income significantly. Raising tuition doesn't bring in more income, for each time tuition goes up, the enrollment goes down, or the amount that must be given away in student aid goes up. Schools are bad businesses, whether public or private, not usually because of mismanagement but because of the nature of the enterprise. They lose money on every customer, and they can go bankrupt either from too few students or too many students. Even a very good college is a very bad business.

        "input":"Smart Exercise  Doctors are starting to find more and more information that suggests a connection between exercise and brain development. Judy Cameron, a scientist at Oregon Health and prefix = st1 \/ScienceUniversity, studies brain development. According to her research, it seems that exercise can make blood vessels, including those in the brain, stronger and more fully developed. Dr. Cameron claims this allows people who exercise to concentrate better. As she says: \"While we already know that exercise is good for the heart, exercise can literally cause physical changes in the brain.\"  The effects of exercise on brain development can even be seen in babies. Babies who do activities that require a lot of movement and physical activity show greater brain development than babies who are less physically active. With babies, even a little movement can show big results. Margaret Barnes, a pediatrician  , believes in the importance of exercise. She thinks that many learning disabilities that children have in elementary school or high school can be traced back to a lack of movement as babies. \"Babies need movement that stimulates their five senses. They need to establish a connection between motion and memory. In this way, as they get older, children will begin to associate physical activity with higher learning,\" says Margaret.  Older people can beef uptheir brains as well.CornellUniversitystudied a group of seniors ranging in age from seventy to seventy-nine. Their study showed a short-term memory increase of up to 40 percent after exercising just three hours a week. The exercise does not have to be very difficult, but it does have to increase the heart rate. Also, just like the motion for infants, exercise for older people should involve some complexity. Learning some new skills or motions helps to open up memory paths in the brain that may not have been used for a long time.  For most people, any type of physical activity that increases the heart rate is helpful. The main goal is to increase the brain's flow of blood. And your brain can benefit from as little as two to three hours of exercise a week.

Even so, most white-collar work still happens in an office. One reason is that, according to findings of a new survey   of office workers conducted by Wakefield Research for the IT company Citrix, most bosses are doubtful about remote working. Half of the workers say their boss doesn't accept it and only 35 percent say it's tolerated. Skeptical bosses will likely have their doubts reinforced   by the same survey, which shows that 43 percent of workers say they've watched TV or a movie while \"working\" remotely, while 35 percent have done housework,and 28 percent have cooked dinner. It is true, however,that working at home makes people much more efficient  , because it allows workers to take care of annoying housework while still getting their jobs done. It's much faster, for example, to shop for groceries at a quarter to three than to stand in line during the after-work rush. The fact that such practices remain officially unaccepted reflects how far we haven't come as a society from the days when we expected every full-time worker to be supported by a full-time homemaker. More broadly the Wakefield survey suggests that employers may be missing a low-cost way to give workers something of value. Sixty-four percent of those survey participants who have worked remotely would rather give up some bonus in order to get even one day a week working from home.

Advice to visit Seattle's Pike Place Market may border on cliche--but for a good reason. \"Whether you're visiting Washington's seaside city for vacation or just stopping by en route to and from the coming Sasquatch music festival, Pike Place is an easy catch-all destination for shopping, eating and just plain walking around,\" said Kirk Johnson, The New York Times's Seattle bureau chief for the past three years. The Seattle Great Wheel is one of many stops to consider in Washington's seaside city. \"Almost any day of the week, especially on the weekend, it's a crazy fun scene of people shopping,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"There's also pretty good food.\" He recommends wandering into whatever place--especially a hole in the wall--catches your eye. There is one specific restaurant Mr. Johnson likes: the Pink Door, which has no signage and can be found only by its rosy entrance. \"It's creative, interesting Italian,\" he said. \"In the summer they get a lot of great fresh vegetables and probably have the best tomato bruschetta I've had.\" He also recommends the nearby Pioneer Square, the oldest neighborhood in Seattle. Its historic architecture has charm, and the area isn't bad for a lunch break, he said. The clear favorite here is Salumi--which, as the name suggests, is known for its cured meats. Mr. Johnson did warn, however, that it's necessary to plan for the fact that the restaurant has a long line as soon as it opens. Pioneer Square is also a portal to Seattle's maritime world that remains alive and well. Ferry rides are a short walk away. Mr. Johnson said the ferry ride to Bainbridge Island provides \"a great view of the city,\" and it's not a long ride back to the mainland. At some point, you may see sculptures emerging on the horizon--that would be the Olympic Sculpture Park, which is operated by the Seattle Art Museum, Mr. Johnson said, and that's worth a visit itself.

        "input":"Psychologists  have known that what's going on inside our head affects our senses. For example, poorer children think coins are larger than they are, and hungry people think pictures of food are brighter. Professor Remi Radel wanted to investigate(look into) how this happens -- whether it's right away, as the brain receives signals from the eyes, or a little later, as the brain's higher-level thinking processes get involved. Radel chose 42 students and each student was told to arrive at the lab at noon after three or four hours of not eating on the day of the test. Then they were told there was a delay. Some were told to come back in 10 minutes; others were given an hour to get lunch. So half the students were hungry when they did the experiment and the other half had just eaten. For the experiment, the participant looked at a computer screen. One by one, 80 words flashed on the screen. A quarter of the words were food-related. After each word, the person was asked how bright the word was and asked to choose which of two words they'd seen -- a food-related word like gateau (cake) or a neutral   word like bateau (boat). Hungry people saw the food-related words as brighter and were better at identifying food-related words. Because the word appeared too quickly for them to be reliably seen, this means that the difference is in perception  , Radel says--it's not because of some kind of processing happening in the brain after you've already figured out what you're looking at. \"This is something great to me, that humans can really realize what they need or what they hope for, to know that our brain can really arrange for our motives and needs,\" Radel says. \"There is something inside us that selects information in the world to make life easier.\" The purpose of Radel's research is to let us know    _   .\nA.how our thinking has effect on our senses happens\nB.what it is the good time for students to have lunch\nC.whether poorer children think coins are larger than they are\nD.whether hungry people think pictures of food are brighter\nAnswer:",

        "input":"Harry Houdini was a man who astonished and attracted many people during his life. Whether he was escaping from a locked box or making things disappear and reappear, he surely was entertaining. People thought that he must truly have some supernatural powers, but in fact, what Harry really had was drive.  Harry was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874. His real name was Ehrich Weiss, the third of five children. His family moved to Wisconsin not long after his birth and when he was nine, he was tying ropes all over his backyard and learning amazing tricks to show his friends and neighbors. He visited the local locksmith, and when he had reached his teens he could pick almost any lock that was made. He also learned how to do card tricks. He and his brother, Theo, would often entertain at local parties and clubs for extra money.  When Ehrich was 16, he came across a book that would actually change his life: the biography of France's greatest magician, Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin. It showed Ehrich that his hobby of magic and tricks could also be a career. Immediately, he changed his name to Harry Houdini. He and Theo headed out to make a living as magicians. In 1893, they performed at the Chicago World's Fair, and after that they traveled around giving magic shows for anyone willing to listen and pay. Theo grew restless, however, as the jobs became scarce, so he left. His timing was perfect since Harry had just fallen in love with a lovely woman named Bess who was just the right size for slipping in and out of the trunk they used in their magic tricks. They married immediately and then off they went, traveling with circuses and other road shows. Harry learned more and more tricks and spent much of his time reading and studying all kinds of locks, especially handcuffs. However, no matter what tricks they did or how hard they tried, Bess and Harry were not doing well. They tried to sell their shows for seven years and finally, in desperation, they went to Europe.           It was the right move. Harry's persistence and constant practice were about to pay off. To get people's attention, he walked into police stations and offered to be handcuffed by all the policemen. They were shocked when he was loose only seconds later. Soon, everyone in Europe was talking about Houdini's astounding skills. He was in high demand and found himself doing more and more dangerous acts. He escaped from a straitjacket hanging upside down over the street; he escaped from locked boxes of all kinds; and, of course, he got out of any kind of handcuffs put on him.           After several years in Europe, Bess and Harry returned to the United States in victory. Harry was doing such amazing tricks that people felt he must have special powers. However, few realized how much time he spent practicing and studying. He would do special exercises to keep his body strong, and he would do tricks with his fingers to keep them flexible. He would spend large amounts of time tying and untying knots -- with his toes! For his underwater tricks, he would get in the bathtub and practice holding his breath for longer and longer times. Since many of his tricks involved being deep in icy water, he would pour buckets of ice in the tub to get accustomed to working in the cold.  The reason that Harry Houdini was such a success was that he practiced and prepared for whatever might happen. When a college student punched him in the abdomen in 1926, however, he wasn't prepared. The punch did internal damage that not even this magician could get out of. Harry died in 1926 at 52 years of age -- a master of his trade and a true legend.

An angry tourist took the photograph of the scrawl and posted it on social media Sina Weibo. It was quickly spread and there were more than 100,000 comments during two weeks. Later, a 15-year-old Chinese boy was searched out as the person who caved this message. Many netizens expressed their anger and disappointment for the uncivilized behavior. They searched and identified the boy and then posted his personal information including the address and pictures online. Over the weekend, his school's website was hacked, and reporters flooded into his home in the city of Nanjing. Besieged by reporters, the child's mother offered a formal apology for her son's behavior. \"We want to apologize to the Egyptian people and to people who have paid attention to this case across China.\" the boy's mother told the local newspaper. With China's economy booming over the past decades, a growing number of the country's residents have become global tourists. Earlier this month, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang addressed: \"Uncivilized behavior of some of tourists is giving this country a bad reputation abroad.\" The discussion about Chinese quality was carried out on many media. On the bright side, Egypt government described the damage to the temple as superficial and could be restored and they would forgive the boy. While the act of Ding Jinhao symbolizes a national shame, meanwhile, many people concern about the child's development and wish he could return to anonymity once more. \"The boy has known his mistake and cried all night.

There's a new type of business franchise that is appearing in shopping malls and neighborhood across America offering pay-per-use  indoor playgrounds, which feature toys, games, guided fun and a workout that doesn't break the family bank. As public playgrounds grow increasingly worn and dirty, the for-profit centers offer clean, safe guided activity as well as a variety of challenging exercises to develop kids' physical fitness, usually for a fee of around $ 5 an hour. \"Playgrounds are dirty, not guided,\" says Dick Guggenheimer, owner of the two-month-old Discovery Zone in Yonkers, N. Y., part of Kansas City-based chain, \"We are indoors; we are padded; parents can feel their child is safe\". In order to satisfy the need of two-earner families, the new franchise stays open in the evenings, long after traditional public playgrounds have grown dark and unusable. However, these new playgrounds are not meant to be day-care centers. Parents are expected to go stay and play with their kids rather than drop them off. But several also provide high-tech baby-sitting services. At some of the Discovery Zones, parents can register their children in special guided programs, then leave them and slip away for a couple of hours to enjoy a movie or dinner.

        "input":"Each year millions of babies are born too soon and too small. Premature or preterm births are defined as births at less than thirty-seven weeks.     Prematurity is the leading cause of death in newborn babies. More than one-fourth of the four million newborns who die each year around the world were born too early.     Preterm babies that survive can suffer a lifetime of serious health conditions. The examples include cerebral palsy, blindness, hearing problems and learning disabilities. Families and communities face emotional, physical and financial costs.     Christopher Howson is the vice president for global programs at the March of Dimes, a nonprofit group. His group and the World Health Organization recently published a report called \"The Global and Regional Toll of Preterm Birth.\"      CHRISTOPHER HOWSON: \"Frankly the crisis of preterm birth is under-recognized, undercounted, undervalued and under-funded. I mean, this report shows that thirteen million babies are born every year preterm, and that over a million of those babies die as a result of being born too early.\"      And these are just estimates; the true numbers could be even higher. More than eighty-five percent of preterm births happen in Africa and Asia. Africa has the highest rate, with about four million cases each year.     Chris Howson says many of the causes of preterm births are related to poverty and weak health-care systems.     CHRISTOPHER HOWSON: \"For example, the poor overall health and nutritional status of women. A high burden of infectious diseases. Lack of provision of family planning - allowing a woman to decide when to start and end having children and how to space her children. And also the lack of good prenatal care programs that might identify problems early on in pregnancy.\"  Preterm births are a problem not just in the developing world. The combined rate in the United States and Canada is the second highest in the world. Preterm birth rates in the United States have increased thirty-six percent in the last twenty-five years.     This has been largely the result of two reasons. One is an increase in pregnancies among women over age thirty-five. The other is an increase in the use of reproductive therapies.

        "input":"If your job requires a lot of sitting, you could be putting your health at danger. The American Journal of Epidemiology   did a study in 2010 on the correlation   between sitting and an individual's physical health. In the study, 53,440 working men and 69,776 working women were surveyed on their time spent sitting. The subjects were all disease free when employed. The researchers identified 11,307 deaths in men and 7,923 deaths in women during the 14-year follow-up. The findings: Women who reported sitting for more than six hours per day had an approximately 40 higher all-cause death rate than those who reported less than three hours a day, and men had an approximately 20 higher death rate. Well, now's a fine time to get this information. But why didn't they tell me this years ago? I would have planned on taking a more active job instead of the sedentary   job of an editor. So what can you do if you have to work for a living at a job that requires a lot of sitting? Here are some ideas: Take frequent breaks. It is recommended that workers vary activities, change their position, and take short breaks every 20 minutes to rest muscles and increase blood circulation. Get a standing desk. Some studies have shown that working from an upright position may be better for health. The serious fitness people can even purchase a treadmill   desk. It only goes about one mile per hour.

        "input":"Many children first learn the value of money by receiving an allowance (pocket money). The purpose is to let children learn from experiences at an age when financial mistakes are not very costly. The amount of money that parents give to their children to spend as they wish differs from family to family. Timing is another consideration. Some children get a weekly allowance. Others get a monthly allowance. In any case, parents should make clear what, if anything, the child is expected to pay for with the money. At first, young children may spend all of their allowance soon after they receive it. If they do this,they will learn the hard way that spending must be done within a budget  . Parents are usually advised not to offer more money until the next allowance. The object is to show young people that a budget demands a choice between spending and saving. Older children may be responsible enough to save money for larger costs, like clothing or electronics. Many people who have written on the subject of allowances say it is not a good idea to pay your child for work around the home. These jobs are a normal part of family life. Paying children to do extra work around the house, however, can be useful. It can even provide an understanding of how a business works. Allowances give children a chance to experience the three things they can do with money. They can share it in the form of gifts or giving to a good cause. They can spend it by buying things they want. Or they can save it. Saving helps children understand that costly goals require sacrifice. You have to cut costs and plan for the future. Requiring children to save part of their allowances can also open the door to future saving and investing. Many banks offer services to help children and teenagers learn about personal finance. A saving account is an excellent way to learn about the power of _ . Compounding works by paying interest.

That's when she heard the whistle sounded by the driver of a train. Her Renault Clio was parked across a railway line. Seconds later, she watched the train drag her car almost a kilometre down the railway tracks. Ceely's near miss made the news because she blamed it on her GPS  . She had never driven the route before. It was dark and raining heavily. Ceely was relying on her GPS, but it made no mention of the crossing. \"I put my complete trust in the device and it led me right into the path of a speeding train.\" she told the BBC. Who is to blame here? Rick Stevenson, who tells Ceely's story in his book When Machines Fail Us, points the finger at the limitations of technology. We put our faith in digital devices, he says, but our digital helpers are too often not up to the job. They are filled with small problems. And it's not just GPS devices: Stevenson takes us on a tour of digital disasters involving everything from mobile phones to wireless keyboards. The problem with his argument in the book is that it's not clear why he only focuses on digital technology, while there may be a number of other possible causes. A map-maker might have left the crossing off a paper map. Maybe we should blame Ceely for not paying attention. Perhaps the railway authorities are at fault for poor signalling system. Or maybe someone has studied the relative dangers and worked out that there really is something specific wrong with the GPS equipment. But Stevenson doesn't say. It's a problem that runs through the book. In a section on cars, Stevenson gives an account of the advanced techniques that criminals use to defeat computer-based locking systems for cars. He offers two independent sets of figures on car theft; both show a small rise in some parts of the country. He says that once again not all new locks have proved reliable. Perhaps, but maybe it's also due to the shortage of policemen on the streets. Or changing social circumstances. Or some combination of these factors. The game between humans and their smart devices is amusing and complex. It is shaped by economics and psychology and the cultures we live in. Somewhere in the mix of those forces there may be a way for a wiser use of technology. If there is such a way, it should involve more than just an awareness of the shortcomings of our machines. After all, we have lived with them for thousands of years. They have probably been fooling us for just as long.

But he couldn't work out the right way to go. It was now getting dark and he was a long way from any place of safety. He knew that he might die that night in the cold temperatures. But Jake kept calm. At home, Jake watched a lot of programmes about living in difficult situations. He remembered the advice from these programmes and knew that he should build a hole in the snow. He made a hole so the wind couldn't blow into it. Outside his hole, the temperature fell to a dangerous -15degC that night, but inside it Jake was safe from the cold. After the long evening passed, Jake began to think his way out. He had to get down the mountain. The TV programmes always said, \"If you are lost, you should find someone else's tracks  through the snow and follow them.\" \"I wanted to live my life.\" remembered Jake, \"So I got up and I found some ski tracks and I followed those.\" He walked and walked and finally saw lights...

        "input":"Part of the fun of watching sports events is following an exciting rivalry  . But where do all these rivalries come from? Some rivalries start because athletes spend a lot of time close to opponents  . Other rivalries get personal. Things that one rival says that are thought to be not respectful to the other can cause a rivalry, even if the words are misunderstood. And sometimes, rivalries grow just because the athletes don't like each other's personalities. Some sports may also be more likely than others to cause rivalries. \"Some sports only meet a few times, so there is less chance for rivalries to build,\" For example, in sports where athletes perform on their own, such as diving, rivalries might also take longer to appear than in sports in which athletes compete at the same time. But in tennis, players often face each other, and rivalries are more likely to happen. So do the rivalries do good or harm to the athletes? Some believe that rivalries can be a good thing because they encourage athletes to try harder to win. But rivalries can also become too personal, taking athletes' attention away from their sports. Keegan agreed that rivalries often do athletes more harm than good. \"They can be a huge distraction   and lead to focusing on the opponent more than the game,\" he said. \"Top athletes often have physical and mental training that they follow in order to worry less and prepare to compete\", Gould further explained. An important part of that preparation is preventing from distractions, including rivalries. \"The better athletes don't care too much about a rivalry - they try to treat every competition the same,\" Gould told LiveScience.

        "input":"We all know that when leaves fall to the ground they die and become food for worms.  When worms pass the leaves, their waste can help to make the soil rich, from which the plants use to get their nutrition. The plants grow and provide food for animals. When the animals eat the plants, their waste goes back into the soil. It's a perfect cycle. But at the Elephant Conservation Centre in Lampang, Northern Thailand, they are using elephant waste for something more--to make 100% natural, beautiful color1ful paper products! 100 years ago over 100,000 elephants in prefix = st1 \/Thailandworked on farms, building sites and even in the army. However, only 6,000 remain there today because of advances in technology that have made elephants' old word less necessary. Elephants are doing new jobs now, including entertaining tourists by painting and playing football, and now by helping in the paper making industry. And their keepers, called Mahouts, can earn a living for their families and help their elephants by using elephant waste, also called \"dung\" to make beautiful, natural, paper products without any bad smell. Every day an adult elephant eats about 200kg of plants like bamboo, grass and watermelon seeds.  His body system breaks the plants into 50kg of fibers, which can produce 115 sheets of fibrous paper. The first step to make this special natural paper is to collect the fiber rich \"dung\" from the elephant.  The next step is to wash it and boil it for five hours to kill bacteria. (The water the use in this process is reused to water plans at the Centre, which, in turn, feed the elephants).  After it's boiled, they cut fibers up. During the cutting process, they add in the desired color1 of the paper. For the fourth step, they take the mixture and make balls of 300g. Each ball is then speeds lightly over bamboo frames to dry into one large sheet of paper. After a few hours in the sun, the sheets are dry enough to remove. The result is a wonderful, 100% natural, recycled paper. People around the world are getting interested in buying this special elephant paper for their holiday cards, writing paper and much more, because it's beautiful, natural and helps so many.

Women lose because, 25 years after the Equal Pay Act, many of them still get paid less than men. They lose because they do lower-paid jobs which men just won't consider. And they lose because they are the ones who interrupt a career to have children.  All this is reported in an independent study ordered by the Government's women's unit. The biggest problem isn't equal pay in workplaces such as factories. It is the sort of work women do. Make a list of low-paid-jobs, then consider who does them. Try nurses, secretaries, cleaners, clerks, teachers in primary schools, dinner ladies and child-care helpers. Not a lot of men among that group, are there? Yet some of those jobs are really important. Surely no one would deny that about nurses and teachers, for a start. So why do we reward the people who do them so poorly?

Local people made it from animal bones and tree branches. They mixed the charcoal with the soil about 1.500 years ago. Now, scientists in the United States have done a modern demonstration. They say charcoal fertilization offers a revolutionary way to improve soil quality for hundreds or even thousands of years. Mingxin Guo and his team at Delavare State University heated tree leaves, corn stalks , small pieces of wood and poultry waste into \"biochar\" . They reported their findings at a recent meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans. Biochar could be good news for farmers with poor soil and hungry populations to feed. Professor Guo says it could even help against global warming. Intensive  farming and overuse of chemical fertilizer give out carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Biochar does the opposite, he says. It traps carbon in the ground. The researchers planted winter wheat in containers of soil in a greenhouse -- some with biochar, some without. Professor Guo says the wheat grows much better in the pots with biochar. The soil was added two percent charcoal to. But he says even a one percent treatment will increase productivity. The results demonstrated that biochar can increase organic matter in soil. Loss of nutrients in soil is an increasing problem worldwide as farmers try to grow more food for growing populations. Next, the team will carry out a five-year study of biochar with spinach , green peppers and tomatoes. Mingxin Guo says he learns about the \"black gold\" in Brazil from a magazine story. He explains that it was discovered in the jungle, in the area where waters flow to the Amazon, in the 1960's. But it was not until recent years that scientists began to bring public attention to it.

They may also be nervous about the well-known fact that they are likely to gain weight this school year. Or will they? While many of us remember the extra weight that showed up right around the start of our college careers, we are not always clear on how much weight we realize gained or why. Many nutrition experts and psychologists think that it is the change in environment and the stress of a new beginning that cause the typical college freshmen to gain extra pounds. As students start a new stage of their lives, many eat to deal with the stress of change or loneliness. Often, college students are making meals or choosing foods independently for the first time in their lives. If they live in the college dormitory, they have a wide variety of foods to select from that may be higher in calories and fatter than the foods they consumed living at home. In addition, college social events usually center around food. I clearly remember sitting in my dorm cafeteria for two or three hours on a Saturday morning socializing with my new friends. Instead of eating only one meal, we would start with breakfast, eat throughout the duration of our socializing, and finish with lunch. Food also makes an appearance after late-night parties, as part of a school day, or simply to break the monotony( ). So will this year's typical freshmen really gain 15 pounds?

He is quiet, gentle and absent-minded and with about as much sense as a child where money is concerned. Well, he applied a post in Camford University. It was a very good post and there were hundreds of candidates who applied for it, and about fifteen, including Theo, were asked to be interviewed. Camford is a very small town; there is only one hotel in it, and it was so full that they had to put many of the candidates two in a room. Theo was one of these, and the man who shared the room with him was a self-confident fellow called Adams, about twenty years younger than Theo, with a loud voice, and a laugh that you could hear all over the hotel. But he was a clever fellow all the same and had a good post in Iscaiot College, Narkover. Well, the Dean, who was the head of the department of the University, and the committee interviewed all the candidates; and as a result of this interview, the number of the candidates was reduced to two, Uncle Theo and Adams. The committee couldn't decide which of the two to take, so they decided to make their final choice after each of the candidates had given a public lecture in the college lecture-hall. The subject they had to speak on was \"The Civilization of the Ancient Summerians\"; and the lecture had to be given in three days' time. Well, for these three days Uncle Theo never left his room. He worked day and night at that lecture, writing it out and memorizing it, almost without eating or sleeping. Adams didn't seem to do any preparation at all. You could hear his voice and his laughter where he had a crowd of people around him. He came to his room late at night, asked Uncle Theo how he was getting on with his lecture, and then told him how he had spent the evening playing bridge, or at the music hall. He ate like a horse and slept like a log; and Uncle Theo sat up working at his lecture. The day of the lecture arrived. They all went into the lecture hall and Theo and Adams took their seats on the platform. And then, Theo discovered, to his horror, that typewritten copy of his speech had disappeared! The Dean said they would call on the candidates on the alphabetical order, Adams first; and the despair in his heart, Theo watched Adams calmly take the stolen speech out of pocket and read it to the professors who were gathered to hear it. And how well he read it! Even Uncle Theo had to admit he couldn't have read it nearly so eloquently himself, and when Adams finished there was a great burst of applause. Adams bowed and smiled, and sat down. Now, it was Theo's turn. But what could he do? He had put everything he knew into the lecture. His mind was too much upset to put the same thoughts in another way. With a burning face he could only repeat, word for word, in a low, dull voice, the lecture that Adams had spoken so eloquently. There was hardly any applause when he sat down. The Dean and the committee went out to decide who the successful candidate was, but everyone was sure what their decision would be. Adams leaned across to Theo and patted him on the back and said, smilingly, \"Hard luck, old fellow, but after all, only one of us could win\". Then the Dean and the committee came back, \"Gentlemen\", the Dean said, \"the candidate we have chosen is Mr. Hobdell.\" Uncle Theo had won! The audience were completely taken by surprise, and the Dean continued, \"I think I ought to tell you how we arrived at the decision. We were all filled with admiration at the learning and eloquence of Mr. Adams. I was greatly impressed. But, you will remember, Mr. Adams read his lecture to us. When Mr. Hobdell's turn came, he repeated that speech, word by word from memory, though, of course, he couldn't have seen a line of it before. Now a fine memory is absolutely necessary for this post; and what a memory Mr. Hobdell must have! This is why we decided that Mr. Hobdell was exactly the man we wanted! \" As they walked out of the room, the Dean came up to Uncle Theo, who was so confused but so happy that he hardly knew whether he was standing on his head or heels; and as he shook Theo's hand he said, \"Congratulations, Mr. Hobdell! But, my dear fellow, when you are on our staff, you must be more careful and not leave valuable papers lying about!\" What do we know about the post at Camford University?\nA.The applicants had to sit for an examination.\nB.There was much competition for the post.\nC.The post requires a lot of teaching experience.\nD.The post offered quite high salary.\nAnswer:",

        "input":"High-tech gadget shows draw throngs of excited consumers each year in the United States, Japan, Europe and the Arabian peninsula. Though many people are already surrounded with all kinds of smart electronic devices, some always need one more -- better and smarter than the previous one. At electronic shows, visitors flock around the newest tablet computers, cameras, 3D television screens, even small robots, dreaming of taking one home. Consumers spend hours waiting in lines and spend hundreds of dollars to be among the first to get the latest smart phone. The modern world seems to _ shiny expensive objects that keep us connected, help us navigate, record our thoughts and memorable events, and even talk to us. So infatuated, we no longer merely \"own\" our gadgets -- we have relationships with them, according to clinical psychologist and life transition therapist Francine Lederer. \"It's a lot easier to have, right, a one-sided relationship with your computer, your phone, than it is with a live person. So that at the end of the day, you don't need to worry about somebody being angry with you, you don't need to worry about getting blamed for anything,\" she said. Magical devices Although having a thousand Facebook friends may be perceived as equivalent to having a thousand real, authentic friendships, Lederer said in reality it is not so. \"It comes down to a lot of the internal stuff. How we feel about ourselves, our own sense of self-esteem, our self-worth, a lot of those things,\" she said. But gadgets are magical. They fascinate us the same way we are intrigued by a magician's trick, said psychology professor at the University of the South Pacific, Robert Epstein. \"If you don't know how they're doing it, that's very fascinating and intriguing. But if they do it 10 times or 20 times or 100 times, it gets boring and you want something else. That's why magicians do not repeat the same trick over and over again,\" he said. Plugged in, isolated Epstein, former editor-in-chief of Psychology Today magazine, said he is concerned that gadgets will take on a life of their own. \"All we're seeing so far is a little bit of the so-called wearable technology that you might wear on your wrist or in your glasses, but we're moving very rapidly, whether the public knows it or not, toward real biological interfaces so that the gadgets will be built into us to some extent,\" he said. Lederer said the danger is that our dependence on electronic gadgets is increasingly being perceived as normal. \"I think our society in a way, and the media, often times normalizes the extent to which we use these gadgets and phones, but the reality is, it's really not healthy for us,\" she said. Scientists predict that gadgets with biological interfaces may be available within the next 20 years and, coupled with strong artificial intelligence, will be much smarter than today. Why do people like to have relationships with gadgets?\nA.Because they are cleverer.\nB.Because they will not have burden with the gadgets.\nC.Because they have no feelings.\nD.Because they are easier to operate.\nAnswer:",

        "input":"The ocean bottom, a region nearly 2.5 times greater than the total land area of the earth, is even today largely unexplored. Until about a century ago, the deep ocean floor was completely inaccessible and hidden beneath waters averaging over 3,600 meters deep. Totally without light and in the case of intense pressures hundreds of times greater than at the earth's surface, the deep-ocean bottom is a strange environment to humans, in some way as frightening and remote as the outer space. Although researchers have taken samples of deep-ocean rocks for over a century, the first detailed global study of the ocean bottom did not actually start until 1969, with the beginning of the National Science Foundation's Deep Sea Drilling Project(DSDP). Using techniques first developed for the offshore oil and gas industry, the DSDP's drill ship, the Glomar Challenger, was able to maintain a steady position on the ocean's surface and drill very deep waters, taking samples of rocks from the ocean floor. The Glomar Challenger completed 96 voyages in a 15-year research program that ended in November 1983. During this time, it sailed 600,000 kilometers and took almost 20,000 samples of rocks around the world. Those samples have allowed geologists to reconstruct what the planet looked like hundreds of millions of years ago and to make out what it will probably look like millions of years in the future. Today, largely on the strength of evidence gathered during the Glomar Challenger's voyages, nearly all earth scientists agree on the theories of plate tectonics   and continental drift that explain many of the geological processes. The sample of rocks drilled by the Glomar Challenger have also provided a climatic record stretching back hundreds of millions of years. The information of past climatic change can be used to predict the future climate.

When they are going to a soccer game or activity, it's common for them to grab a cold bottle of water out of the fridge with them.In fact, Americans buy more bottled water than any other nation in the world, about 29 billion bottles a year. But all these plastic bottles use a lot of fossil fuels and pollute the environment.In order to make all the 29 billion bottles, producers use 17 million barrels of crude oil, which is enough to keep a million cars going for 12 months. So why don't people drink water straight from the tap? Some people have a strong belief that bottled water is better than water out of the tap, but that's not necessarily true.In the US, the local governments make sure water from the tap is safe.There is also growing concern that chemicals in the bottles themselves may go into the water. People love the convenience of bottled water.But maybe if they realized the problems it causes, they would try drinking from a glass at home or carrying water in a reusable steel container instead of plastic. Some argue that plastic bottle recycling can help.Recycled bottles can be turned into items like carpeting or clothing.Unfortunately, only one in six bottles is recycled.The rest make it to landfills or end as trash in other places.Plastic bottles take hundreds of years for them to _ . Water is important for you, so keep drinking it.But think about how often you use water bottles, and see if you can make a change.

Maybe one of these dads will make you remember your own dad! The male giant water bug doesn't seem to mind a heavy load on his back for his kids. The female puts about 100 to 150 eggs on the back of the male, and then she leaves. Once the female is gone, the male has to look after the eggs. It usually takes one to two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The father giant water bug jumps around to make sure the growing eggs get enough air and water. All this time he can't fly because of the weight of the eggs growing rapidly on his back. Now let's turn to the male stickleback fish. When the mother leaves after laying her eggs, the father tends his young. If the young fish go too far away, their father helps with their safe return by carrying them back in his mouth. The male stickleback looks after all his young -- as many as 100 -- until they can live on their own. A similar example can be found in emperor penguins living in cold areas. The male emperor penguin goes without food while looking after his egg until it hatches.

        "input":"Trying to recover from a devastating economic crisis, Spain is considering moving the country's clock back by one hour. Many people regard long afternoon naps and late dinners as perfect aspects of the Spanish way of life. Until the 1940s, Spain was on the same time as Britain and Portugal. In World War II, Spain and Portugal moved the clocks forward to align them with Nazi Germany. The same happened in Portugal. After the defeat of Hitler, Portugal returned to Greenwich Mean Time, but Spain did not. \"The fact that for more than 71 years Spain has not been in its proper time zone means we sleep almost an hour less than the World Health Organization recommends,\" lawmakers in the Spanish Parliament wrote in a proposal.\"This has a negative effect on productivity, absenteeism, stress, accidents and school drop-out rates.\" Last September, a parliamentary commission recommended that the government turn back the clocks by one hour and introduce a regular eight-hour workday. For the time being, the Spanish government is treating the campaign seriously but it hasn't taken any action yet. Spain's time zone issue explains why everything in Spain happens later, from meal times to broadcast entertainment (primetime doesn't start until 10 pm). Many urban Spaniards complain of a never-ending workday that begins in the morning but is interrupted by a traditional late-morning break and then again by the midday siesta--a two-hour long lunch and nap that usually start at 2 pm. If workers return to their desks at 4 pm, they end up working late into the evening. Under the proposed new schedule, the lunchtime break would be cut to an hour or less. The interruption-filled Spanish workday would be replaced by something closer to a 9-to-5 schedule. Ignacio Buqueras, president of the Association for the Rationalization of Spanish Working Hours, told The New York Times that changing the Spanish schedule would be good news for working mothers. It would also allow families more free time together and boost Spain's economic recovery. Maria Angles Duran, a sociologist with the Spanish National Research Council, is skeptical that changing the time zone will reverse low productivity, which she attributes more to the structure of the service-oriented economy. But she agreed that a more normal work schedule would help women, who often complain that their husbands deliberately schedule meetings in the early evening. \"For men, this is perfect,\" Duran said, \"They arrive home and the children have already had their baths! Timetables can be used as a sort of weapon.\" According to the passage, Duran may agree with the following except that   _  .\nA.the new schedule will allow families more free time\nB.women will probably benefit from the new schedule\nC.economic structure influences economic performance\nD.men can escape housework in the existing schedule\nAnswer:",

What excited the experts were two other projects that located two huge pits with similar features. \"It is absolutely a miracle. These relics indicate that there could be a tomb group in this area, which is likely to be important for China's archaeological   studies,\" said Ma Juncai, a leading relic researcher in the province. In ancient China, carts, sheep, spoons and so on were buried to ensure that dead people had a happy afterlife. The number and quality of the sacrifices indicated the social status of the dead. The custom was carried into the Qin Dynasty. Emperor Qinshihuang's tomb, located near Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi Province, is accompanied by thousands of wood or clay figures of warriors and horses. The tomb is probably the most well-known.

People younger than thirty years of age usually do not know that they are starting to forget information. But scientists from the University of Michigan say the loss of memory has usually already started. Researchers say people do not observe this slow reduction in mental ability until the loss affects their everyday activities. Denise Park led the new study. She directs the Centre for Aging and Cognition at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Her team studied more than 350 men and women between the ages of twenty and ninety years. The study identified people in their middle twenties with memory problems. She says young adults do not know they are forgetting things because their brains have more information than they need. But she says that people in their twenties and thirties are losing memory at the same rate as people in their sixties and seventies. Ms. Park says people between the ages of sixty and seventy may note the decrease in their mental abilities. They begin to observe that they are having more trouble remembering and learning new information. The study found that older adults are more likely to remember false information as being true. For example, they remembered false medical claims as being true. Younger people remembered hearing the information. But they were more likely to remember that it was false. Ms. Park is now using modern imaging equipment to study what happens in the brains of people of different ages. She is studying what parts of the brain older adults use for different activities compared to younger adults. Ms. Park says mental performance is a direct result of brain activity and brain structure. She says keeping the brain active is important. She hopes future studies will identify ways to improve the operation of our aging minds.

You'd be able to look at the ancient treasures without worrying about other visitors pushing you for a better view. Well, in two years time you'll be able to have such an experience, just like the former emperors used to. The only difference is that your Forbidden City fun will be online. Thanks to new technology, a virtual tour of the Forbidden City will be available online by 2008. The project - jointly driven by the Palace Museum and computer company IBM - aims to help teenagers around the world become more interested in Chinese culture. The project will offer an interactive, three-dimensional view of the palace. The virtual tour will provide images from all over the 780,000-square-metre palace. \"The Palace Museum is a big book; there are always places you haven't read about,\" said Hu Chui from the museum. There are many rooms closed for protection. But the virtual platform breaks the boundaries of time and space, meaning visitors can see whatever they want. \"The interaction and games content in the virtual tour will attract more young people to understand and love our cultural heritage,\" added Hu. In the virtual tour, historical figures will actually talk to visitors and answer their questions. The stories behind the buildings and treasures will also be told. \"The online environment, presented in both Chinese and English, enables visitors to experience the culture and stories of the museum,\" said James Yeh, an IBM official.

        "input":"Dan Bebber is a senior research fellow at the University of Exeter in Britain. He says research has shown that wild plants and animals are moving toward Earth's North and South poles as the planet warms. Mr Bebber wanted to know if the same thing was happening with organisms that attack agricultural crops. He examined reports of first sightings of new insects and diseases around the world. The records came from CABI - the Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International. He says the group began collecting information from developing and industrialized countries years ago. Dan Bebber and his research team studied 612 different organisms - from viruses and bacteria to insects like beetles and butterflies. They found that since 1960, crop pests and diseases have been moving toward the poles at an average rate of about 3 kilometers each year. Mr Bebber says this puts the most productive farmland in the world in danger. \"As new species of pests and diseases evolve and potentially the environment for them becomes more _ at higher latitudes, the pressure on the breadbaskets of the world is going to increase.\" Farmers face other threats. Invasive species passed through trade are also causing problems. Gene Kritsky is an Entomologist at the College of Mount St. Joseph in Ohio. He specialises in the study of insects. He says climate change may improve conditions for some invasive species. \"It means that species in other parts of the world that might do well in warmer temperatures can now do well in the breadbasket of America.\" Another Entomologist Christian Krupke of Purdue University says the effects of these changes will depend very much on the crop, the insect and the disease. But he says the research is a warning sign that people should care about climate change and do something about it. Which of the following is not a threat that farmers have to face?\nA.Climate change helps crop pests to adapt to new environment.\nB.Foreign species are brought in by trade.\nC.Invasive species doing well in warmer places might do well in America.\nD.The impacts of the climate and species changes on crops are not easy to determine.\nAnswer:",

John Grogan discovered _ after he and his wife adopted a Labrador that they named Marley. The dog caused Mr. Grogan a lot of trouble, but it also provided many stories for his newspaper articles. Later, he wrote a best-selling book, \"Marley and Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog.\" Marley was happy and fun-loving. But he was also extremely large and difficult to control. He bit anything that he could find around the house, including plastic, clothing and jewelry. And he had a great fear of loud noises, especially thunderstorms. Unfortunately, the Grogans lived in Florida where many thunderstorms develop. Marley would attack the furniture, walls and doors until his feet bled if he was left alone in the house during a thunderstorm. Marley almost damaged their home several times. John Grogan said that at first he considered that probably his dog could be trained to be a show champion. But he soon realized that was impossible. Marley didn't like to learn skills that didn't belong to dogs, and he was driven out of the dog training school for causing troubles for other dogs. He didn't want to hide his emotions. He would show his anger and tiredness if he felt them. Even if that, Marley still had earned a place in the Grogans'.

Thanks to a new free trade agreement signed last Monday between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN),more and more tropical Southeast Asian fruit will enter the country. The agreement means that from July 1,2005, China and ASEAN countries will begin to cut tariffs. There are about 7,000 products included in the cuts. As global communication develops, countries are trading more and more goods with each other. When products are sold across national borders, countries put a tax on them. This type of tax is called a tariff. Just like removing an obstacle from the path of these goods, the reduction of tariffs will encourage trade between China and ASEAN countries. It means more products and lower prices. The agreement will bring real benefits for Chinese customers, said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman. \"In the Beijing markets you will easily find more tropical fruit like durian, which used to very, very, very expensive. Now they will be cheaper.\" The current tariff rate on durian is 22 per cent but will fall to zero in 2005. In the first 10 months of this year China did US$84.6 billion of trade with ASEAN countries. Experts believe this may reach US$100 billion next year.

They look so much alike that they could be brother and sister. Do you believe that people who live together for many years would look alike? It's strange. but scientists say it's true. How scientists proved it? In a study, scientists found young couples only showed similarity by chance. However, elder couples were very likely to look like each other. The similarity could be very subtle  and could be found in wrinkles  or furrows, etc. Besides, some couples look far more alike than other couples. The scientists thought of several possible reasons: 1. Diet. \"We are what we eat.\" As couples usually share the same diet, will they probably look alike? For example, if both partners eat a high fat diet, their faces will tend to look fat. However, the scientists ruled this out  using another small study. 2. Environment. Will elderly couples show similarity because they live together in the same area for a long time? The environmental factors  such as sunshine and wind affect the skin in similar ways. The scientists ruled this possibility out as well. 3. Empathy . This is the theory  the scientists believe in. Couples grow to look similar because they are empathizing with each other. They copy each other's facial expressions. For example, if one partner often smiles in a certain way, the other is likely to copy it. In this way, their faces share similar wrinkles and furrows.

He alleged that his marriage broke down after his wife had an affair with his agent, and that she had also transferred the couple's joint assets. Ma has hit back at Wang, accusing him of abandoning their family. The topic has sparked a debate about relationships and divorce. It seems Wang's situation has struck a chord with many - which could explain the number of views, which are high even by Chinese standards. The divorce quickly became a top trending topic in China. According to micro blog Sina Weibo, posts with the hashtag \"Wang BaoQiang Divorce\" have been viewed over five billion times. Chinese netizens seem to have rallied around Wang, with topics like \"Wang Don't Cry\" \"Wang We Support You\", quickly trending after news of the divorce spread.

That's down by seven places comparing with that last year. The Chinese mainland belongs to the low-proficiency tier  and is ranked just above Thailand in Asia. This year's index has increased the weight of listening tests, while decreasing the importance of grammar and vocabulary exams, which partly caused the ranking change, researchers said. Moreover, test-oriented  and rote-based learning methods often used in China hurt the language skills of Chinese students, education experts said. The study compared test scores of more than 1.7 million adults in the 54 countries and regions. Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands have the best command of English, while Libya has the lowest English proficiency level. European countries generally performed well.

But at the Elephant Conservation Centre in Lampang, Northern Thailand, they are using elephant waste for something more--to make 100% natural, beautiful color1ful paper products! 100 years ago over 100,000 elephants in prefix = st1 \/Thailandworked on farms, building sites and even in the army. However, only 6,000 remain there today because of advances in technology that have made elephants' old word less necessary. Elephants are doing new jobs now, including entertaining tourists by painting and playing football, and now by helping in the paper making industry. And their keepers, called Mahouts, can earn a living for their families and help their elephants by using elephant waste, also called \"dung\" to make beautiful, natural, paper products without any bad smell. Every day an adult elephant eats about 200kg of plants like bamboo, grass and watermelon seeds.  His body system breaks the plants into 50kg of fibers, which can produce 115 sheets of fibrous paper. The first step to make this special natural paper is to collect the fiber rich \"dung\" from the elephant.  The next step is to wash it and boil it for five hours to kill bacteria. (The water the use in this process is reused to water plans at the Centre, which, in turn, feed the elephants).  After it's boiled, they cut fibers up. During the cutting process, they add in the desired color1 of the paper. For the fourth step, they take the mixture and make balls of 300g. Each ball is then speeds lightly over bamboo frames to dry into one large sheet of paper. After a few hours in the sun, the sheets are dry enough to remove. The result is a wonderful, 100% natural, recycled paper. People around the world are getting interested in buying this special elephant paper for their holiday cards, writing paper and much more, because it's beautiful, natural and helps so many. What is the famous product mentioned in the passage?\nA.Paper.\nB.Dung                    .\nC.Fibers.\nD.Bamboo frames.\nAnswer:",

        "input":"Slang is a popular, less official and often very current form of language. It is an important part of a living language and is constantly changing as language changes. Slang is often playful, direct and sometimes less respectful than the more official and traditional version of language. So now I'm going to lay it on you! To \"lay it on\" is American slang for \"to tell\" or \"to explain.\" Slang can take many forms. For example, slang can be local to one city or area. In Washington, D.C. there is a whole set of slang to describe politics and business in the city. For example, the term POTUS stands for President of the United States. POTUS can often be found with his wife, FLOTUS, the first lady of the United States. \"Inside the Beltway\" is a popular expression that describes the area of Washington, D.C. The beltway is the large highway that circles the city. The Internet has helped create a whole new kind of computer-related slang. An \"angry fruit salad\" is an expression that describes a website with too many bright colors. \"Netiquette\" is slang for correct behavior when using the Internet. Young people often develop the latest slang. For example, to say Special English \"rocks\" or is \"phat\" means Special English is really great. A \"kegger\" is a party where beer is served.  If something is \"wack\", it is wild and crazy. Different professions often have their own slang as well. For example, medical workers might refer to a complaining patient as a \"gomer\".  A \"tough stick\" is someone whose veins are difficult to find when he or she needs to have blood taken. No matter how well you speak English, there are always new and interesting slang words to discover. There are entire dictionaries for describing slang. Many experts do not even agree on what is and what is not slang. Often slang words later become a part of officially accepted language. Official or not, slang is an energetic and exciting part of the American language that continues to change. It can be inferred from the passage that  _  .\nA.if you speak English very well, there is no problem for you to understand English speakers\nB.slang words are created by people in their daily life\nC.English speakers are clear whether it is a slang\nD.slang words will never be accepted as official language\nAnswer:",

But there is no evidence to show that the structure of eyes is changed by wearing glasses at a young age. Wearing the wrong glasses, however, can prove harmful. Studies show that for adults there is no danger, but children can develop loss of vision if they have glasses inappropriate for their eyes. We have all heard some of the common myths about how eyesight gets bad. Most people believe that reading in dim light causes poor eyesight, but that is untrue. Too little light makes the eyes work harder, so they do get tired and strained. Eyestrain also results from reading a lot, reading in bed, and watching too much television. However, although eyestrain may cause some pain or headaches, it does not permanently damage eyesight. Another myth about eyes is that they can be replaced, or transferred from one person to another. They are close to one million nerve fibers  that connect the eyeball to the brain, so it is impossible to attach them all in a new person. Only certain parts of the eye can be replaced.

One ancient rhino called Indricotherium was the largest land mammal that ever lived. It was 5m high at the shoulders, and 8.5m long-- twice the size of today's biggest elephant! The living rhinos are still big, averaging 2-3m long and weighing up to 3,600kg. To see all five species of living rhino you would need to do a bit of exploring. First you might visit Africa for a look at the white rhino and the black rhino. They live in Africa's dry woodlands and grasslands. Then you could head to India and Nepal for a look at the Indian rhino. It lives in the high grasslands near rivers, where you have to ride an elephant to find one.

They rely on their strong sense of smell to tell them a stranger is approaching, but if the wind is blowing the wrong way, they may not know someone is there until it's too late. Rhinos can be found only in their habitats, which is why habitat destruction has caused rhino populations to decline. As they disappear from certain places, their absence leads to many changes to the landscape. For example, black rhinos in Africa only eat shrubs   and small trees, pruning   the plants and limiting their growth. Many other species benefit from this, and as rhinos disappear, so do many other animals sharing their habitat.

Atacama is so  _ that the surrounding mountains that reach up to 6885 m, have  ly no glaciers! In the region, the river beds have been dry for over 120,000 years.

If you find that surprising, you'd be shocked to find out that this desert has lakes!  When there was rainfall in the region (many year ago), this accumulated water created what we now know as the Salt Lakes. The name of these lakes was given as a result of the effect of the Atacama environment: the long dry period makes the water evaporate ,resulting in the higher concentrations of salt in the remaining water. This region has been tested by scientists to see if life is present in the Atacama soil with the same instruments that would be used to detect life in the soil on Mars!

        "input":"Three Chinese astronauts on June 24 successfully completed a manual docking between the Shenzhou-9 spacecraft and the orbiting Tiangong-1 lab module, _ in China's history of space exploration. It means China has completely grasped space rendezvous and docking technologies and the country is fully capable of transporting humans and cargo to an orbiter in space, which is essential for building a space station in 2020. Astronaut Liu Wang, assisted by his teammates Jing Haipeng and Liu Yang, controlled the Shenzhou-9 spacecraft to dock with the Tiangong-1 space lab module at 12:48 p.m., which were reconnected about seven minutes later. About one and a half hours before the docking, Shenzhou-9 parted from Tiangong-1 to a berth point 400 meters away from the module. To leave room for adjustments, engineers set up four berth points for the spaceship on the same orbit 5 km, 400 meters, 140 meters and 30 meters away from the orbiting lab. \"The manual docking was beautifully conducted. The manual docking was completed in only 7 minutes, 3 minutes faster than the automatic docking.\" said Liu Weibo, who is responsible for China's astronaut system. Liu explained to Xinhua the three factors behind today's manual docking success. Firstly, Liu Wang has grasped the sophisticated manual docking technologies very well and his psychological status has been sound. Secondly, the three astronauts were in close cooperation. Thirdly, the domestically-made docking system was reliable, he said. The astronauts, 343 km away from Earth, were also greeted by Chinese oceanauts from the Mariana Trench, 7,020 meters beneath the Pacific Ocean, where they just broke the country's dive record in a manned submersible on Sunday morning. \"We hope the manual docking is a great success and wish for brilliant achievements in China's manned space and manned deep-sea dive causes,\" read the message sent by the three oceanauts aboard the manned submersible Jiaolong. Wu Ping, spokeswoman for China's manned space program, said Sunday the manual space docking was \"a complete success.\" She told a press conference in Beijing that the three Chinese astronauts had already re-entered the space lab module to continue their scientific experiments. The manual docking is a significant step for China's manned space program that celebrated its 20th anniversary this year, as China has fully grasped space travel, space walk and space rendezvous and docking technologies that are essential to building a space station. China is the third country, after the United States and Russia, to acquire technologies and skills necessary for space rendezvous and docking and be able to supply manpower and material to an orbiting module via different docking methods. According to Liu Weibo, which of the following is not the factor contributing to the successful docking?\nA.Liu Yang has grasped the sophisticated manual docking technologies very well\nB.The astronaut's psychological status has been in good condition.\nC.The three astronauts cooperated with other closely.\nD.The domestically-made docking system was reliable.\nAnswer:",

        "input":"When different species of birds flock   together, their flight formations are determined by social dynamics both between and within species. New research from the Universities of Cambridge and Exeter reveals for the first time that, contrary to current models used to explain the movement of flocks, the differences between bird species and social relationships between individuals play a critical role in determining the dynamics of mixed-species flocks. The unified  behaviour of bird flocks has puzzled scientists for hundreds of years. One naturalist from the turn of the century even suggested telepathy may be involved. There have since been more logical explanations, including mathematical models that show that repeated interactions among individuals following simple rules can _ coordinated  group movements. However, these models usually rely on the assumption that individuals within groups are identical and interact independently, which may not reflect reality. Jolle Jolles, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology and author of the paper, said:\"Spectacular collective behaviour can be found in a large range of animal species, and we now know that often these complex coordinated group movements may be the result of individuals following simple rules. However, rarely are the individual characteristics and social relationships within them taken into account. Our research highlights that these striking displays of group behaviour are much more complex.\" By analysing high-resolution photographs of mixed flocks of rooks and jackdaws (both from the corvid family), the researchers found that rather than individuals interacting in a consistent fashion throughout the flock, interactions depended on social dynamics between the different species as well as relationships within a species. The researchers discovered that birds prefer to fly close to members of their own species, and that the larger and more dominant rooks take the lead by flying near the front of flocks. Additionally, the lifelong, monogamous pair bonds that are characteristic of both species seem to be reflected in flight, as birds often fly particularly close to a single, same-species partner. Dr Alex Thornton, principal investigator of the Cambridge Jackdaw Project, now at the University of Exeter and author of the paper, said: \"Together, our findings demonstrate that to understand the structure of groups -- such as bird flocks -- we need to consider the characteristics and relationships of the individuals within them.\" What is the main idea of the passage?\nA.How birds interact in simple rules.\nB.How birds of different feathers flock together.\nC.Why birds show preference to flocking.\nD.Why birds display the characteristics.\nAnswer:",

Learned people agreed that the earth was round: their only questions were how long and how dangerous would be a trip to reach the Orient. Christopher Columbus, the son of an unknown weaver, and himself a weaver of ambitious dreams, made his historic voyage to the New World in 1492. He didn't go to school very much, but be learned to read and write Spanish during his travels. He also taught himself Latin because all the geography books were written in Latin. Sailing with a tiny fleet of three ships, the Santa Maria and two smaller ships, the Pinta and the Nina and a crew of ninety sailors, be found the thirty-three-day crossing easier than his nearly-decade-long effort to find royal sponsors willing to support it. The trip drew not only on his own skills as an expert ship's captain, but also on his ability to plan such an expedition, obtain governmental approval and financing, and finally, demonstrate its success so that such explorations could continue. He tried for years to get King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella to supply him with ships and money. Finally they agreed, but he made more demands. He wanted to be made a knight, admiral of the Ocean Sea. He wanted to be the viceroy and governor general of all lands he would discover. Also he wanted one-tenth of everything he found of value in the new lands. The explorations that followed Columbus-those of Cabot, Verrazano, Cartier, and many others-benefited from a new maritime technology borrowed from Arab sailors and from a variety of new vessels (,) such as the light-weight caravels employed by Columbus. Sailors also perfected sails and various types of riggings that gave ships added stability and greater maneuverability on the open seas. And when leaving sight of the coast, new navigational aids-charts, compasses, and astrolabes-permitted them to determine their position with some, though not perfect, accuracy. Columbus himself made a total of four voyages to the New World but he did not become rich as he had hoped. At the end of his life he only had a pension the king and queen had given him because he was the first to reach the New World. He spent the last few months of his life in bed because of the pain of arthritis . Columbus not only discovered a New World, but led the way for other explorers. We can learn from the passage that   _  .\nA.Christopher Columbus was an ambitious explorer\nB.he was a geologist with ambitious dreams\nC.Columbus became extremely wealthy after making a total of four voyages\nD.he was an unsuccessful canvasser\nAnswer:",

They can actually be found in many places on the earth, but not in quantities that can be mined. Only a few countries -- China, America, India, Australia, Brazil and Malaysia have any that can be mined enough to be traded. Even though some of these elements such as Cerium are as abundant as Copper, they are not found in concentrated amounts on the earth's surface. They are often mixed together with other metals, which makes extraction   of these elements an expensive and an environmentally messy process. It was due to this reason that the term \"rare earth\" was invented. Rare earth metals are used widely in our life. Rechargeable car batteries, computers, iPhones, DVD players, computer monitors, televisions, lighting, lasers, glass polishing, and superconductors all use quantities of rare earth metals. Also, with the advancement in \"green\" technology like solar panels, these shiny materials are becoming more important than ever. An average electric car uses 10 pounds of Lanthanum for its rechargeable battery! America has large deposits   of rare earths and has one of the first mines. It was opened in Southern California in 1940. The element \"Europium\" was the first metal to be separated in quantity for use in color televisions. However, in the 1980's and 1990's, as China started producing these elements in Inner Mongolia, the mines in America and elsewhere could not keep pace. The mine in Mountain Pass, California also failed environmental regulations and shut down in 2002. Now, recognizing the importance of having more than one supplier of this important resource, other rare earth owning countries like India and Australia are either dusting off their rare earth mines or speeding up their production.

The thing that is so special about April 1 is that it is the day for playing tricks and practical jokes on others. The aim of these jokes is to bring embarrassment to others. Superstitions have it that the practical jokes are meant to be played before noon, and that those that are performed afterwards will bring bad luck. This limitation is widely losing its value due to the fact that many major hoaxes throughout history appear after noon. Another superstition is that anyone who fails to respond properly to the jokes played on them is also said to be easy to suffer from bad luck.

Some people believe that being married on April Fools' Day is not a good idea for a man, and that forever in the future he will be ruled by his wife. The origin of April Fools' day is not clearly known, but it is generally accepted to have come about as a result of the changes in the calendar system.

That number represents more than half of the world's population. Health officials are warning that failure to repair cavities can lead to social and emotional problems. Wagner Marcenes is with the Institute of Dentistry at Queen Mary, University of London. He led a team of researchers as part of the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study. About 500 researchers attempt to collect and examine studies about all major diseases. They used the information to estimate rates of the infection. The report says untreated tooth decay is the most common of all 291 major diseases and injuries. Professor Marcenes says cavities or holes  in permanent teeth are also known as caries. \"Caries is a chronic disease that shares the same risk factors as cancer, cardiovascular disease. What we're having now is an increase in disease from highly developed countries happening in sub-Saharan Africa and probably it will be in other areas of Africa, too.\" He says an increase in tooth decay in Africa could be a result of developing countries becoming more like Western nations. \"It is likely to be related to a change in diet. Our industrialized diet leads to chronic disease, which includes caries. And that may be the main explanation.\" Western diets are rich in sugar, a leading cause of health problems in the mouth. Wagner Marcenes says oral health problems can have a major effect on a person's quality of life. First, cavities make eating difficult. Second, people may change what they eat. They may eat softer foods that are not hard to chew. However, softer foods are often fattier foods. But professor Marcenes says the biggest issue in tooth decay is both social and mental. He says the researchers found strong evidence that the mouth has a big influence on socialization. He says many people want to hide bad teeth. They smile less and communicate less. Wagner Marcenes is calling for an \"urgent, organized, social response\" to the widespread lack of oral health. He believes in a natural method to fight tooth decay by having a healthier diet. He is also calling for the development of new and less costly dental materials and treatments.

In slow parenting children are allowed to do what they think proper and parents just keep a watch over the child. Curiosity of the child leads to exploring and discovering things. Parents provide little help only when it's too necessary, otherwise keep themselves away from the child and just have a look on him\/her: This brings about a feeling of self-dependency and they are encouraged to solve their problems. This is a natural way of learning. When a child is left to learn in a natural environment, the child's natural development takes place. Influence of any materialistic way doesn't let the mind develop naturally. Watching TV, playing video games or joining classes of dance, swimming or any other sports will not let the mind develop naturally. Here creativity of their mind is developed. They explore ideas. The logic behind this is that the kids of animals learn by nature, so can our kids. So let our children play in the garden, to watch flowers, plants, birds, butterflies and other gifts of nature. In the classes of dance, swimming etc. their creativity is influenced and their natural creativity is suppressed  . In these classes they are overburdened and can't train their creativity. So let them play in the open air or garden without any burden instead of joining classes. Generally parents give toys to their children and explain how to operate them.

        "input":"People joke that the so-called travel is to leave one's familiar places and visit others' familiar places, which refers to the phenomenon of taking travel as sightseeing in different places. In fact, going travel does not simply mean pursuing fashion or widening vision. It is a kind of social experience and dynamic learning. Furthermore, it is a process of expanding cognition  and understanding society and life, and especially has advantages and charm in increasing knowledge and widening vision.     The ancient people not only mentioned \"traveling a thousand miles\" and \"reading a thousand books\" together but also regarded them as the necessary course of perfecting personality and making progress. Going travel can widen the life path and give it new social meanings and spirits of the time, making it socialized, popular, industrialized and fashionable.     Under these circumstances, special efforts should be made to bring culture back to tourism and have culture conveyed in tourism. By doing so, the soul of tourism will be helpful for people to learn and think. In this way, tourists can combine relaxations and joys with learning and thinking, and improve their minds while visiting historic relics.     Once tourism departs from culture, it will be stuck in vulgarity  and shallowness, and make it difficult to develop tourism. Some tourist cities and spots are so commercialized that people are put in no mood for the enjoyment of cultural and historic flavors of ancient buildings. Furthermore, in some places, historic and natural relics are decreasing, while more and more artificial scenes and antiques   block the view of real scenes and mislead people with false information and historic relics.     Culture is the core of tourism. Taking back the culture as the soul provides the right way for the development of tourism, and the build-up of spiritual home and social civilization.

        "input":"Don't worry, be happy and, according to new research, you will also be healthy. It is estimated that over the course of one year, Americans suffer 1 billion colds. But new research shows that all it may take to avoid this common affliction is a positive and upbeat attitude.          People who are energetic, happy and relaxed are less likely to catch a cold than those who are depressed, nervous or angry, finds a new study published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine. Healthy volunteers first underwent an emotional assessment in which they were asked to rate their tendency to experience positive and negative emotions--how often they felt pleased, relaxed, happy, or anxious, depressed and hostile. The subjects were next given a squirt up the nose of a rhinovirus, the nasty little germ that causes colds.          Researchers then watched the volunteers to see who came down with a cold and waited to see how the unlucky ill manifested their cold symptoms. \"We found that people who regularly experience positive emotions, when exposed to rhinovirus, are  ly protected from developing illness,\" said Dr. Sheldon Cohen, lead author of the study and a psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University.\" Increases in positive emotional styles were linked with decreases in the rate of clinical colds, but a negative emotional style had no effect on whether or not people got sick,\" Cohen said.          So how can your emotions influence your health? In simple terms, when the brain is \"happy\" it sends messages to our organs that help keep the body healthy and sound.\" It's like a drug that is released by your state of mind and simply changing the state of mind can produce effects on the rest of the body through the nervous system and hormones,\" said Dr. Neil Shulman, associate professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine and author of Doc Hollywood. \"Your chance of developing the common cold, pneumonia, or even cancer may very well be decreased by keeping your brain in a healthy state.\"          In addition, happy and relaxed people tend to better health practices than their negative and stressed counterparts. They are more likely to get plenty of sleep and to engage in regular exercise, and have been shown to have lower levels of certain stress hormones. According to the passage, people are advised  _\nA.to get plenty of sleep.\nB.to engage in regular exercise.\nC.to stay positive against getting ill\nD.to wear heavy clothes in cold seasons\nAnswer:",

But more often than not there is a chain of events leading up to the misfortune-frustration, tiredness or just bad temper-that show what the accident really is, a sort of attack on oneself. Road accidents, for example, happen frequently after a family quarrel, and we all know people who are _ , so often at odds with themselves and the world that they seem to cause accidents for themselves and others. By definition, an accident is something you cannot predict or avoid, and the idea which used to be current, that the majority of road accidents are caused by a minority of criminally careless drivers, is not supported by insurance statistics. These show that most accidents involve ordinary motorists in a moment of carelessness or thoughtlessness. It is not always clear, either, what sort of conditions make people more likely to have an accident. For instance, the law requires all factories to take safety actions and most companies have safety committees to make sure the regulations are observed, but still, every day in Britain, some fifty thousand men and women are absent from work due to an accident. These accidents are largely the result of human error or misjudgment-noise and fatigue, boredom or worry are possible factors which contribute to this. Doctors who work in factories have found that those who drink too much, usually people who have a high anxiety level, run three times the normal risk of accidents at work. The passage suggests that  _  .\nA.accidents mostly result from slippery roads\nB.accidents are usually caused by psychological factors\nC.doctors run three times the normal risk of accidents in factories\nD.about 50,000 people lost their lives at work in Britain every day\nAnswer:",

Julianna's teacher, Kourtney Denning, thinks highly of e-books. \"Traditional books aren't good enough anymore,\" she said. \"We have to transform our learning as we know it.\" Julianna's mother, Cathy Ivancic, said that electronic devices  like the IPad were new and fun and gave children the motivation to read, including those who didn't like reading. Some people, however, are suggesting a closer look, especially for younger children learning to read. \"Read traditional books with your child.

        "input":"A growing number of Chinese are keeping their cash in their wallets this Lunar New Year as the traditional exchange of red packets of money is moving from the physical world into the digital space.      The tradition of giving cash gifts of \"lucky money\" (\"hong bao\" in Chinese) goes back centuries and can be particularly profitable for the young and the unmarried. As the country increasingly adopts online business and e-commerce models, tradition is taking a back seat to convenience as more and more lucky money receivers prefer to receive their money via electronic means. A recent study conducted by Shanghai-based Avanti Rhesearch Partner showed that 58% of respondents   preferred their hong bao directly deposited into their accounts.       The country is becoming increasingly connected --- over 90% of 18 to 30 year olds in China own an Internet-connected smart phone, according to a Global Times survey published last year.       Of course, China's Internet giants have not been slow to capitalize on this trend, with Shenzhen-based Tencent last week launching their \"New Year Red Envelope\" app  , an add-on to its popular WeChat messaging service. The company's over 600 million WeChat users can send each other lucky money, provided both the sender and receiver have signed up to the company's in-app payment service.      \"I am really happy that I can use a new and fashionable way to send my holiday greetings to my family and friends, especially for people who have kids but live far away from us.\" said Mr. Cheng, a user of the service.      The service reportedly banked 18 million RMB ($2.9 million) worth of transfers   in its first 24 hours, according to a report in the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper.      While Tencent's rival Alibaba also has a similar service, called Hong Bao, which launched last year, WeChat's app allows users to randomly distribute up to 200 yuan ($33) within a group of friends, adding a fun element of unpredictability to the process.      Some analysts believe that linking the payments to WeChat's in-app payment service could be a game-changer, as it simplifies the process of paying for micro dealings, potentially making users more likely to make in-app purchases in the future.       \"The tradition of giving red packets is a symbolic gesture,\" said Steve Wang, Chief Economist, Reorient Group. \"It's a new way to get people more comfortable dealing with money online, to expand their user base.

The report is about experiments which transplant human cells into animals for medical purposes. It claimed that concerns about the creation of talking apes should be taken seriously. It should also draw people's attention to the possibility that the medical research about creating \"humanised\" animals is going to generate monsters. A regulatory body is needed to closely monitor any experiments that many risk creating animals with human-like consciousness or giving them any appearance or behavioural traits that too closely resemble humans, the report said. Scientists would, for example, be prevented from replacing a large number of an ape's brain cells with human brain cells until more is known about the potential risks. This has already been done in simpler animals like mice, which is judged to be less risky. Under the new UK guidelines, the power to regulate tests on animals containing human material would be transferred to a body with wider responsibility for animal testing in the Home Office. While there is no risk from experiments currently being carried out in Britain, it is possible that ethical   boundaries could be crossed within the next few years if scientists are not careful, the experts said. Professor Thomas Baldwin, a member of the Academy of Medical Sciences working group that produced the report, said the possibility of humanised apes should be taken seriously. He said, \"The fear is that if you start putting very large numbers of human brain cells into the brains of primates you might transform the primates into something that has some of the abilities that we regard as distinctly human, such as speech, or other ways of being able to _ or relate to us.\" Professor Martin Bobrow, chair of the academy working group that produced the report, said, \"The very great majority of experiments present no issues beyond the general use of animals in research and these should continue to proceed under the current regulations.\" Lord Willis, chair of the Association of Medical Research Charities, said, \"AMRC only supports research that is absolutely necessary and where no suitable alternative methods are available.\" What is the passage mainly about?\nA.Ethical rules to limit humanised animals.\nB.The potential results of humanised apes.\nC.The possibility of humanised animals.\nD.The danger of human-like animals.\nAnswer:",

Britain's reputation as a grumpy country may, however, simply be the result of a cultural misunderstanding.

Remembering the terrorist attacks in London on July 7, 2005, Stuart Colley, who lived in the capital at the time, said: \"It seemed to me that most people's response was a 'cruel' determination to carry on and not to 'fall' into an over-emotional outpouring of grief or anger - despite what many of us felt inside.

When I picked up the book again a few years later, I too was astonished at how much it had improved--and shortly afterwards shocked by the fact that not only could I be a fool in all sporting, artistic and practical matters, I could also be so when it came to reading too. On rereading, then, I learned that Anne is indeed a dear and most lovable child. I couldn't help adoring the girl who insists that her name be spelled with the \"e\" instead of Ann as she believes that is \"so much more distinguished.\" She is a brave and determined survivor of a severe upbringing who has refused to let her circumstances crush her spirit.

In July, last year, I couldn't believe the news that I was allowed to enter the only key high school in my hometown. Then I rushed to my home and told my parents. But my father didn't seem as excited as I was. They didn't say a word. My father just kept smoking and my mother put her head down and couldn't help crying. What I saw didn't make me surprise. I knew very well what my family was like. My mum had been in bed for two years because of her disease. I knew my family lived a hard life and couldn't afford my tuition fee  . I felt so upset at that moment, but I could say nothing to my parents. I decided to help my father with his work to support my family instead of continuing my schooling. To my surprise, things completely changed just three days before the beginning of the new term. My head teacher who had taught me three years came to my family with some money, which had been raised by my schoolmates. He encouraged me, \"Always have dreams.\" At the same time,my father also earned some extra money so that he could afford part of my tuition fee. I knew I was such a lucky dog and decided to study harder in return. With tears in my eyes, I stepped into the key high school that I had dreamed of. I have been studying hard since I entered the high school. Whenever I meet difficulties, I always think of my teacher and schoolmates, and I can always get enough courage to go on, because I have a college dream and must work hard for it no matter how hard the life is.

Much of north and central China, or one-seventh of the country, was covered in it over the weekend.     Responses have included reduced industrial activities, a ban on fireworks and barbecues, raised pollution alerts and reduced vehicles travelling on the roads. Citizens are advised to stay indoors while schools have either stopped classes or suspended outdoor activities.     And Chinese officials, after a long period of prioritizing economic development over environmental protection, are now likely to see their future career shaped by how effectively they handle the serious pollution. \"Even as a foreigner, I know the pollution has a lot to do with too much focus on economic indicators in evaluating Chinese officials,\" said Florian Kessler, an executive director with German law firm WZR Consulting. The German executive speaks fluent Chinese, loves Beijing food and is a big fan of Beijing Guo'an Football Club, but after staying in the city for eight years, he now wants to leave. \"Since I smoke, I'm okay with the pollution, but I can't let my kid breathe in the polluted air. That's why I'm leaving,\" Kessler explained.     He also said that German companies operating in Beijing, such as BMW, Benz and Volkswagen, have all had a hard time finding staff willing to work here.     China has repeated in the past that we would not follow the old path of industrialized nations to develop first and deal with pollution afterward. But the smog is an awkward reminder that our country is already on that path. Whether we can change route depends on the choice Chinese officials make between environment and growth in the years ahead. Why do those German companies mentioned in the passage have a hard time?\nA.Because it is hard for them to find staff who like working here.\nB.Because they have kids.\nC.Because they lack money.\nD.Because Chinese officials don't like them.\nAnswer:",

Being out of high school meant I finally grew up. Soon I would be on my own, making my own decisions, doing what I was interested in without someone looking over my shoulder  .     There was never any question in my mind that I would go to college. But which college I would attend seemed like a never-ending list of unknowns: What would college be like?  Would I make friends easily? Would I miss my family so much that I wouldn't be able to stand it? What if the college I selected turned out to be a terrible mistake?     Then panic set in.  My feelings took a 180-degree mm. I really didn't want to leave high school at all. It had been nice being respected as a Senior by the underclass students for the past year; I didn't enjoy the idea of being on the bottom of the ladder again.     Despite months of expectation, nothing Could have prepared me for the impact of the actual day. As the familiar tune of \"Pomp and Circumstance\" echoed   in the background, tears welled up uncontrollably in my eyes, and I was consumed by a rush of sadness.

Where is the Bermuda Triangle located? The mysterious triangle is believed to be situated between Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico, where too many unusual events have happened. On December the 5th1945, five U.S. military planes took off from Florida on a clear day only to disappear over Bermuda. Furthermore, some other disappearances took place; in 1947, an American C54 plane simply disappeared at 100 miles from Bermuda; at 80 miles, a Star Tiger plane disappeared in 1948. Even Columbus had trouble in Bermuda. Some of his journals were about the strange happenings there: \"the waters are changing their colors\" and \"compasses are going wild\". Maybe it's why it is called the Devil's triangle or the Atlantic cemetery. Many _ were stated in order to explain the strange events. In spite of these attempts, the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle remains unsolved. Some people get to say that maybe aliens are involved in it. Other imaginative scientists relate the happenings in Bermuda to Einstein's theory, saying that the missing ships and planes are translated to another dimension of space and time and taken into another world.

The analysis was conducted at the request of The Associated Press to investigate the legitimacy of talk of a cooling trend that has been spreading on the Internet, fueled by some news reports, a new book and temperatures that have been cooler in a few recent years. In short, it is not true, according to the statisticians who contributed to the analysis. The statisticians, reviewing two sets of temperature data, found no trend of falling temperatures over time.US government data show the decade that ends in December will be the warmest in 130 years of record-keeping, and 2005 was the hottest year recorded. The case that the Earth might be cooling partly stems from recent weather. Last year was cooler than previous years. It has been a while since the superhot years of 1998 and 2005. So is this a longer climate trend or just weather's normal ups and downs? In a blind test, the AP gave temperature data to four independent statisticians and asked them to look for trends, without telling them what the numbers represented. The experts found no true temperature declines over time. \"If you look at the data and sort of cherry-pick a microtrend within a bigger trend, that technique is particularly suspect,\" said John Grego, a professor of statistics at the University of South Carolina. Yet the idea that things are cooling has been repeated in opinion columns, a BBC news story posted on the Drudge Report and in a new book by the authors of the best-seller Freakonomics. Last week, a poll by the Pew Research Center found that only 57 percent of Americans now believe there is strong scientific evidence for global warming, down from 77 percent in 2006.

        "input":"The first step in exercising for most people is determining whether or not they should. This is particularly true with anyone over thirty-five, especially if they have been heavy smokers. Likewise, young adults who have been very inactive should proceed slowly and with caution. A physical evaluation from a physician is recommended, preferably one that includes an exercise-stress test. While a person is exercising, a stress test detects cardiovascular  problems that might not show up when the body is at rest. This is done by monitoring blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen consumption, and the heart's electrical activity while exercising. Whatever exercise program is selected, it is important to start with warm-up periods. These should include stretching exercises, jumping jacks, or active walking. The idea is to increase heart rate and circulation slowly without placing a sudden strain on the heart or the muscles that are starting to work. The next phase in developing an exercise program is to determine the amount of exercise that is enough to condition the muscles and cardiovascular system without excessively exhausting the body. This involves taking one's pulse and finding one's target zone. This target zone, or safe-training pulse rate, is established by subtracting one's age from 220 and then taking 60 percent to 80 percent of that total. If you are just starting to exercise, 60 percent is recommended; 80 percent is recommended if you are already in good condition. In order not to place much strain on the body, if you are a beginner and at the age of 45, the safe training pulse rate suggested would be   _  .\nA.105\nB.220\nC.140\nD.175\nAnswer:",

        "input":"American doctors have been trying to figure out the secrets behind Asians being healthier than Americans since the early 90s - The Japan has the lowest mortality rates in the world and Chinese medicine has been around for thousands of years, since around 2000 B.C. only meant that there's more to Asian health philosophy. In Asian medicine, there's an acknowledgment of the whole-body theory of medicine, instead of isolationism that's prevalent in many American doctor's offices. The main reason behind a better health lies in the difference between Asian and American culture. Diet, exercise, and a holistic approach to medicine all contribute to Asians living longer and healthier than their American counterparts. In addition, the result of the Asian lifestyle has led to a stronger overall immune system and better detoxification  efficiency. The more preferred drink in the American lifestyle is soda, beer or coffee. However, in Asian culture, the preferred drink is water or herbal tea. Consumption of water serves to immediately strengthen one's body detoxification program, since water dilutes toxins and helps flush the body. Americans savor red meat and pork, while most Asians prefer chicken, rice and fish. Also, the foods in Asia are mostly organic and lack the hormonal toxins that American food carries. Overall the Asian diet leads to less food-introduced toxins into the body, and allows the body to spend its energy on its immune system rather than toxin control. Also, the fish that Asians consume have very strong immunological effects, providing more antioxidants than the red meat preferred in America. The average American family has more than one car. In Asia, on average there's 1 car per 4 families. In Asian cultures, people use bicycles more than four-wheeled transportation. The Asian lifestyle also involves more labor and physical work, such as agricultural labor and gardening. The American lifestyle praises white-collar jobs which lead to Americans sitting in front of computer screens for hours on end. Exercise helps detoxification in two ways: it speeds up metabolism, and induces sweat.  Medicine in Asia centers mostly on natural ingredients that have healing properties. Asian medicine also addresses the mind-body connection and the importance of mental balance. There are more traditional medicine doctors per person in Asia than in America. American medicine costs more and is symptom-focused, often ignoring the overall cause of the symptoms. In America, the prescriptions that are chemically derived are dangerous toxins that stress the body's detoxification system. Using Asian medicine means using only natural ingredients, which the body can easily detoxify while getting the same health benefit. It is not very difficult to adopt the Asian lifestyle and improve your body's detoxification and immune system. You can change your lifestyle today by eating and drinking organic, exercising rigorously at least three times a week, and using organic health alternative therapies over dangerous prescription medicines. ks5u Emma Deangela is the author of detox and fasting site at eDetoxify.com. Combining both Asian and Western philosophy, Emma Deangela has helped many people by giving them health consultation to make their lives better and healthier through natural health philosophy.

        "input":"There are various ways in which individual economic units can interact with one another. Three basic ways may be described as the market system, the administered system, and the traditional system. In a market system individual economic units are free to interact among each other in the marketplace. It is possible to buy commodities from other economic units or sell commodities to them. In a market, transactions may take place via barter or money exchange. In a barter economy, _ goods such as automobiles, shoes, and pizzas are traded against each other. Obviously, finding somebody who wants to trade my old car in exchange for a sailboat may not always be an easy task. Hence, the introduction of money as a medium of exchange eases transactions considerably. In the modern market economy, goods and services are bought or sold for money. An alternative to the market system is administrative control by some agency over all transactions. This agency will issue commands as to how much of each good and service should be produced, exchanged, and consumed by each economic unit. Central planning may be one way of administering such an economy. The central plan, drawn up by the government, shows the amounts of each commodity produced by the various firms and allocated to different households for consumption. This is an example of complete planning of production, consumption, and exchange for the whole economy. In a traditional society, production and consumption patterns are governed by tradition; every person's place within the economic system is fixed by parentage, religion, and custom. Transactions take place on the basis of tradition, too. People belonging to a certain group or caste  may have an obligation to care for other persons, provide them with food and shelter, care for their health, and provide for their education. Clearly, in a system where every decision is made on the basis of tradition alone, progress may be difficult to achieve. An inactive society may result.

During one interview, she noticed that the candidate never made direct eye contact. She was puzzled and somewhat disappointed because she liked the individual otherwise. He had a perfect resume and gave good responses to her questions, but the fact that he never looked her in the eye said \"untrustworthy,\" so she decided to offer the job to her second choice. \"It wasn't until I attended a diversity workshop that I realized the person we passed over was the perfect person.\" Tiffany admits. What she hadn't known at the time of the interview was that the candidate's \"different\" behavior was simply a cultural misunderstanding. He was an Asian-American raised in a family where respect for those in authority was shown by turning away your eyes. \"I was just thrown off by the lack of eye contact, not realizing it was cultural,\" Tiffany says. \"I missed out, but will not miss that opportunity again.\" Many of us have had similar experiences with behaviors we describe as different. As the world becomes smaller and our workplaces more diverse, it is becoming essential to expand our understanding of others and to reexamine some of our false assumptions   . Hire Advantage At a time when hiring qualified people is becoming more difficult, employers who can have no personal biases   from the process have an obvious advantage. My company, Mindsets LLC, helps organizations and individuals see their own blind spots. A real estate   agent we worked with illustrates the positive difference such training can make . \"During my Mindsets coaching period, I was taught how to own a diversified workforce. I employed people from different cultures and skill sets. The agents were able to make use of their full potential and experiences to build up the company. When the real estate market began to change, it was because we had a diverse agent pool that we were able to stay in the real estate market much longer than others in the same profession.\" Blinded by Gender Dale is an account executive who attended one of my workshops in charge of a diverse workforce. \"Through some of the lessons, I discovered my personal bias.\" he recalls. \"I learned I had not been looking at a person as a whole person, and being open to differences.\" In his case, the blindness was not about culture but rather gender. \"I had a management position open in my department; and the two finalists were a man and a woman. Had I not attended this workshop, I would have automatically assumed the man was the best candidate because the position required quite a bit of extensive travel. My assumption would have been that even though both candidates were great and could have been successful in the position, I assumed the woman would have wanted to be home with her children and not travel.\" Dale's assumptions are another example of the well-intentioned but incorrect thinking that limits an organization's ability to promote the full potential of a diverse workforce. \"I learned from the class that instead of forcing my gender biases into the situation, I needed to present the full range of duties, responsibilities and expectations to all candidates and allow them to make an informed decision.\" Dale sings high praise for the workshop, \"because it helped me make decisions based on fairness.\" A better Bottom Line An open mind about diversity not only improves organizations from inside, it is profitable as well. These comments from a customer service representative show how an inclusive attitude can improve sales.\" Most of my customers speak English as a second language. One of the best things my company has done is to contract with a language service that offers translations over the phone. It wasn't until my boss received Mindsets' training that she was able to understand how important inclusiveness was to customer service. As a result, our customer base has increased.\" Once we start to see people as individuals, we can move positively toward inclusiveness for everyone. Diversity is about coming together and taking advantage of our differences and similarities and about building better communities and organizations. When we begin to question our assumptions and challenge what we think we have learned from our past , from the media, peers, family, friends, etc, we begin to realize that some of our conclusions are imperfect or contrary to our fundamental values. We need to train ourselves to think differently, shift our mindsets and realize that diversity opens doors for all of us, creating opportunities in organizations and communities that benefit everyone. Which of the following statements will Dale not agree with about Mindsets LLC's workshop?\nA.It helped him make fair decisions.\nB.It helped him discover his personal bias about gender.\nC.It helped him look at a person as a whole one.\nD.It helped him find successful candidates.\nAnswer:",

These rules say that nature should decide what happens to the park. Alsten also writes that the elk herd  has grown too big. The elks walk on the riverbanks. They eat the new grass and roots of baby trees. The beavers   need the trees to build dams. The dams raise the water levels. Higher water levels put more water into the soil. Moist soil helps plants grow faster. The plants offer homes and food to other animals. Chase thinks that the park rules would work only in a park with natural settings. He believes that Yellowstone has had an artificial setting for a long time. The native people left. The wolves were taken away and other animals were removed.The areas of land were fenced off and other animals added.He thinks the park rules that let herds grow too big and the fires burn are hurting the nature of the park.

        "input":"Do we really know what dinosaurs looked like? Of course we do. We see them everywhere, not only in museums, but also in movies, magazines, and even in the toys we get from McDonald's. Since the days of early cinema, dinosaurs have captured our imaginations. They are often shown as scaly   beasts with sharp horns   and crocodile-like bellies  . But the big screen dinosaurs are \"a leap from what we know\", Mark Norell, who studies dinosaurs at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, told Discover magazine. The reality of drawing dinosaurs for movie studios, magazines, or museums is that the artist often only has half of a skeleton to work with. Many existing and newly-discovered dinosaurs do not have a complete skeleton, which makes it difficult to tell what they looked like. And even with a complete skeleton, there is a lot of room for interpretation.   \"Look at an elephant's trunk   and ears,\" Jason Brougham, a dinosaur sculptor   at the American Museum of Natural History, told Discover magazine. \"It's impossible to guess those features by only looking at the skeleton.\" Researchers suggest that the dinosaurs of old could have had trunks like an elephant or even red necks like a turkey. They could have had colorful spots, stripes  , and other interesting patterns on their bodies, just like snakes. Yet, with only a few fossilized   bones to study, it is impossible to know for sure. Remember the cruel and quick-running velociraptors   in the US film Jurassic Park? Now experts believe that they were much smaller than in the movies, about the size of a large chicken, the BBC has reported. Since the 1990s, some well-preserved dinosaur fossils have been found in China's Liaoning province. Thanks to that, we have known for a while that one group of dinosaurs was covered in feathers. And thanks to the recent discovery of a feathered plant-eating species in Russia, many scientists now believe more dinosaurs than we previously thought had feathers, much like a chicken. Also, in 2007, scientists confirmed that the closest living relative of T-Rex, the most feared and famous of all the dinosaurs, is a chicken. Now, who are you calling \"chicken\"? Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the article?\nA.Dinosaurs used to have red necks and thick feathers.\nB.Most dinosaurs are much smaller than we previously thought.\nC.The chicken has been proven to be the closest living relative to the dinosaur.\nD.Fossils are still our main source of knowledge about dinosaurs.\nAnswer:",

If other people understood what I was saying, then that was good enough. I didn't mind repeating myself many times. Before testing me, the speech specialist asked me what I thought of having good speech. I told her I thought it was not important. \"Well, when you are in an interview for a job, and they don't know what you are saying, what are they going to say to you? Nice meeting you, bye,\" she said. Maybe good speech was important. I took part in 20-minute classes each week with the specialist. After she tested me, she told me that I spoke too fast, and didn't give enough eye contact  . I learned that when I made eye contact with someone, it meant that I was talking to that person, and I could also see what he or she thought about what I was saying. When my first speech class started, I found that I had been speaking too fast to be understood. Every time I spoke too fast, the specialist stopped me and told me to start again.

Only 174 survived, including 22 of the 29 crew members. The sinking left more than 260 people dead with about 40 others still missing. On Tuesday, one ordinary diver died at a hospital, government spokesman Ko Myung-seok said. He is the first death among divers organized following the ferry's sinking, according to the coast guard. The 53-year-old diver was pulled to the surface by his teammates after losing communication about five minutes after he began underwater searches, Ko said. It was his first search attempt, Ko added. Despite his death, divers are continuing their searches for the remaining missing people. Ko said that divers had searched all those 64 areas at least once and plan to visit them again to look for more victims. Darkness, floating rubbish, bodies, and cabins on board have made the search difficult, and divers entered the last three unopened areas on Monday night, Ko said. Investigators have made their first arrests of people who were not on board the Sewol when it sank. The three people arrested on Friday and Sunday are accused of failure to handle of cargo on the ferry well. In all, 19 people have been arrested in the investigation , 15 of whom were crew members accused of abandoning passengers. A leader was arrested on suspicion of malpractice  related to company finances. Improper stowage  and overloading of cargo is suspected as a possible reason why the ferry sank. The ferry was carrying about 3,608 tons of cargo, more than three times what it could safely carry. A ferry loaded too heavily could lose its balance making even a small turn. The sinking has caused a national sadness. On Sunday 1.1 million people paid respects at 131 memorial sites around the nation, according to a governmental funeral support committee set up for the ferry victims. Monday was a holiday for Children's Day, but various events were canceled or put off because of the ferry's sinking.

        "input":"When my grandfather died, my 83-year-old grandmother, once so full of life, slowly began to fade. No longer able to manage a home of her own, she moved in with my mother, where she was visited often by other members of her large, loving family. Although she still had her good days, it was often hard to arouse her interest. But one chilly December afternoon three years ago, my daughter Meagan, then eight, and I were visiting her, when she noticed that Meagan was carrying her favorite doll.\"I, too, had a special doll when I was a little girl,\" she told a wide-eyed Meagan. \"I got it one Christmas when I was about your age. I lived in an old farmhouse in Maine, with Mom, Dad and my four sisters, and the very first gift I opened that Christmas was the most beautiful doll you'd ever want to see.\" \"She had an exquisite(,), hand-painted face, and her long brown hair was pulled back with a big pink bow. Her eyes were blue, and they opened and closed. I remember she had a body of kidskin, and her arms and legs bent at the joints.\" GG's voice dropped low, taking on an almost respectful tone. \"My doll was dressed in a pretty pink gown, decorated with fine lace. ... _ -- my parents must have had to sacrifice so much to afford it But how happy I was that morning!\" GG's eyes filled and her voice shook with emotion as she recalled that Christmas of long ago. \"I played with my doll all morning long. And then it happened. My mother called us to the dining room for Christmas dinner and I laid my new doll down gently on the hall table. But as I went to join the family at the table, I heard a loud crash.\" \"I hardly had to turn around -- I knew it was my precious doll. And it was. Her lace skirt had hung down from the table just enough for my baby sister to reach up and pull on it. When I ran in, there lay my beautiful doll on the floor, her face smashed into a dozen pieces. She was gone forever.\" A few years later, GG's baby sister was also gone, she told Meagan, a victim of pneumonia . Now the tears in her eyes spilled over -- tears, I knew, not only for a lost doll and a lost sister, but for a lost time. Subdued  for the rest of the visit, Meagan was no sooner in the car going home than she exclaimed, \"Mom, I have a great idea! Let's get GG a new doll for Christmas. Then she won't cry when she thinks about it.\" My heart filled with pride as I listened to my sympathetic little daughter. But where would we find a doll to match GG's fond memories? Where there's a will, as they say, there's a way. When I told my best friends, Liz and Chris, about my problem, Liz put me in touch with a local doll-make. From a doll supply house I ordered a long brown hair and a kidskin body to copy the outfit GG had so lovingly described. Liz volunteered to put the doll together, and Chris helped me make the doll's outfit. Meagan wrote the story of the lost doll by giving examples. Finally our creation was finished. To our eyes it was perfect. But there was no way it could be exactly like the doll GG had loved so much and lost. Would she think it looked anything like it? On Christmas Eve, Meagan and I carried our happily packed gift to GG, where she sat surrounded by children, parents, aunts, uncles and cousins. \"It's for you,\" Meagan said, \"but first you have to read the story that goes with it.\" GG no sooner got through the first page than her voice cracked and she was unable to go on, but Meagan took over where she left off. Then it was time to open her present. I'll never forget the look on GG's face as she lifted the doll and held it to her chest. Once again her tears fell, but this time they were tears of joy. Holding the doll in her frail arms, she repeated over and over again, \"She's exactly like my old doll, exactly like her.\" And perhaps she wasn't saying that just to be kind. Perhaps however impossible it seemed, we had managed to produce a close copy of the doll she remembered. But as I watched my eight-year-old daughter and her great-grandmother examining the doll together, I thought of a likelier explanation. What GG really recognized, perhaps, was the love that inspired the gift. And love, wherever it comes from, always looks the same. This passage implies that   _  .\nA.treating the elderly well is moral\nB.it is impossible to copy the exact doll for the elderly\nC.love, the permanent rhythm of life, will always remain in the elderly's heart\nD.physical comfort from children rather than psychological care is important\nAnswer:",

That night Perlman walked slowly to his chair. Then he sat down and began to play. But, suddenly, one of the strings on his violin broke. You could hear it break---it broke with a loud noise. People thought to themselves, \"He would have to get up to either find another violin or find another string for this one.\" But he didn't. Instead, he waited a moment, closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again. The orchestra began, and he played from where he had stopped. He played with such passion and such power. Of course, everyone knows that it is impossible to play a symphonic work with just three strings. But that night Itzhak Perlman refused to know that. You could see him changing and recomposing the piece in his head. When he finished, there was a silence in the room. Then people rose and cheered.

And I liked the stories behind them, which made me forget all other things. McDonald's, Apple, Mercedes Benz and Adidas own great logos as well, and they are among my favorites. Nike In the Greek myth, Nike is the goddess of victory and the source of inspiration for soldiers. This logo represents the wing in the famous statue of the Greek goddess. Nike's logo was designed by Carolyn Davidson in 1971 for $ 35, and was registered as a trademark in 1995. McDonald's The logo was designed in 1962 by Jim Schindler to resemble the archshaped  signs on the side of the company's then walk-up hamburger stand. Later on, the two golden arches were combined together to form the M. The McDonald's name was added to the logo in 1968. Apple There are different stories behind Apple's logo. The first logo was a reference to the religious story of Adam and Eve, in which the apple represented the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. One year later, the second logo was designed in 1977 by Steven Jobs and Ronald Wayne, and it described Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. This logo didn't stay long. One year later it was replaced almost immediately by graphic designer Rob Janoff's \" rainbow apple\", a rainbow- colored silhouette    of an apple with a bite taken out of it. And then the rainbow- colored apple was replaced by the one- colored logo in 1998. It has not been changed so far. Mercedes Benz The Mercedes Benz logo, which was originally created by Gottlieb Daimler in 1909, consists of a simple description of a three- pointed star that represents its rule of the land, the sea and the air. The company was founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Marcedes is the name of Maybach's elder daughter, while Benz came as a result of a combination with Benz, Cie.and DMG in 1926. Adidas The Adidas logo, which was created by the founder of the company Adi Dassler, represents mountains, pointing towards the challenges that are seen ahead and goals that can be achieved. The logo was used for the first time in 1976. What does Nike's logo stand for?\nA.The goddess of victory\nB.The source of inspiration for soldiers\nC.The statue of the Greek goddess\nD.The wing of the Greek goddess.\nAnswer:",

The divers felt as if they were going down steps as they passed through warm and cold layers of water.In time, the temperature dropped to freezing point and the men shivered inside the ball.They kept in touch with the mother ship by telephone describing how they felt.Then , at a depth of 3,000 feet, the telephone stopped working and they were quite cut off from the outside world.All went well until some four hours later at 30,000 feet, the men were startled by a loud, cracking noise; even the smallest hole in the ball would have meant instant death.Luckily, though, it was only one of the outer windows that badly broken.Soon afterwards, the bathyscaphe touched the soft ocean floor raising a big cloud of \"dust\" made up of small, dead sea-creatures.Here, powerful lights lit up the dark water and the men were surprised to see fish swimming just above them quite untroubled by the enormous pressure.But they didn't dare to leave the lights on for long, as the heat from the lights made the water boil.Quite unexpectedly, the telephone began working again and the faint but clear voices of the officers were heard on the mother ship 7 miles away.After a stay of thirty minutes the men began their journey up, arriving three hours later, cold and wet through, but none the worse for their experience.

In the early stages of skill or character development, imitation is helpful, When I first learned to cook, I used recipes and really cooked some tasty dishes. But soon I grew bored. Why did I have to follow someone else's way of cooking when I could create my own? Imitating role models  is like using  training wheels on a child's bicycle.

Choose the one that fits best according to the information given in the passage When top engineers in Germany wanted to build a more energy-efficient car, they headed to the natural history museum to study dolphins and sharks. But it was the boxfish  that interested them. \"We were surprised when this clumsy-looking fish became our model for designing an aerodynamic  car\",says Thomas Weber. He is the research and development chief for the car company Daimler. An aerodynamic design reduces wind drag and increases fuel efficiency. The boxfish may look clumsy, but it can start, stop ,back up and zigzag  through the water with ease. And it does all this using surprisingly little energy. Daimler's bionic  car is modeled on the fish's boxy skeletal   system. Like the fish, the car is fast and drives easily. It's efficient too. The science behind nature-inspired inventions is called biomimicry  . Biologist Janine Benyus came up with the term. As co-founder of the Biomimicry Guild, she has worked with cereal companies,sneaker designers and others to develop products based on Nature's best ideas. This month ,the Nature's 100 Best List will be revealed at the World Conservation Congress  in Barcelona ,Spain. Benyus co-authored the list of nature inspired designs with economist Gunter Pauli. In Zimbabwe ,a country in southern Africa ,engineers designed energy-efficient buildings modeled on termite  mounds  . The buildings use vents   to keep the air flowing and the temperature cool. A company in Atlanta ,US ,developed a self-cleaning paint modeled on the lotus  leaf. When the paint dries ,it becomes bumpy  ,just like the lotus leaf. Rain drops form on the bumps and roll off ,carrying dirt along with them. Nature has done billions of years of research. Only the best-designed products have survived. Companies owe Mother Nature a debt for all that hard work ,says Benyus. For scientists and inventors, the possibilities for copying nature are limitless. Technology may never be as efficient as nature, or as color1ful. But that doesn 't mean we should stop trying to learn from the world around us. Take a walk outside. Watch a squirrel climb up a tree.

Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food Dr York Chow says the contingency plan would come into force if an outbreak occurred near Hong Kong. Speaking on a radio talk show this morning, Dr Chow said the separation of poultry from humans policy, which will be determined after a decision whether to set up a central slaughtering   house or several regional ones, would be based on the demand for live chickens. He pointed out that at present there were 30,000 live chickens imported from the Mainland and 30,000 supplied locally. If this demand persisted, there would be no central slaughtering house or wholesale point that could handle such an amount and regional slaughtering houses could be the choice. He added that building of regional slaughtering houses took time, but stressed the need to study the views of the public and the sector before a final decision was made. Regarding avian flu vaccination   for humans, Dr Chow said it was still being developed. He added that it may not be reliable in the case of an outbreak as records show vaccination can only offer 5% protection against a virus. He said Hong Kong had more experience and expertise than neighbouring territories in the fight against viral outbreaks, and was willing to offer them help. He added there was no \"boundary\" for infectious diseases and close cooperation among different countries had to be maintained to fight against a possible outbreak.

The slave owner reached for a heavy weight. He threw it at his slave. Instead, it hit Harriet on the head. Harriet almost died. For the rest of her life, she carried the mark of a deep wound on her head.    Miser Brodas felt he never needed Harriet. He decided to sell her. Harriet thought of a way to prevent this. Each time she was shown to someone who might buy her, she acted as if she were falling asleep. After a while, Mister Brodas gave up the hope of selling Harriet. He sent her back to the fields. At 24 she married a free black man, John Tubman. By then, Harriet was sure she should escape.    In 1849, Mister Brodas died. His slaves probably would be sold to further South. John Tubman tried to make Harriet forget about running away. Harriet decided she must end her marriage and that she needed to tell her family that she was leaving.    Harriet escaped for Pennsylvania where slavery was banned there. Once she hid under hay that had been cut from the fields. Another time, she wore men's clothing. Finally, she arrived in Pennsylvania.    Now that Harriet was free, she didn't forget other slaves in Maryland. During the next ten years, she freed her parents and other family members. She traveled back and forth eighteen times, helping about 300 slaves escape. She became an expert at hiding from slave hunters. At one time, anyone finding Harriet was promised 40,000dollars for catching her--dead or alive. The people she helped called her Moses. She had rescued them from slavery just as the biblical Moses rescued the Jews.    After the Civil War began, Harriet started to spy for the North. She also served as a nurse.

Time management is not necessarily working harder, but quicker and more smartly. Sometimes our mistakes will keep us from running at a full pace. Here are the top four Time Management mistakes we should all avoid to help us to increase our daily success. a. Start your day without a plan of action in the morning. If so, you will have worked hard but may not have done enough of right things. Time Management is not doing the wrong things.  b. Work with a messy desk or work area. Studies have shown that the person who works with a messy desk spends one and a half hours per day looking for things. If you have ever visited the office of a top manager who is working with a clean desk, you will find that the manager works efficiently . c. Don't get enough sleep. Studies show that nearly 75% of the people around us complain about not having  enough sleep, and then throughout their days they are tired. For most people, they get the quantity of sleep, but they lack the quality of sleep. Their days are filled with so much stress; they are out of control, working harder but maybe not more smartly, so it's difficult for them to get a full night's sleep.  d. Don't take a lunch break. Many do not take a lunch break, working through that period in the hope that it will give them more time to increase their success. Studies have shown that it may have the opposite effect. After doing what we do for several hours, we start to feel tired. A lunch break, even short, gives us a chance to get our energy back again.

        "input":"Can people change their skin colour without suffering like pop king Michael Jackson? Perhaps yes. Scientists have found the gene that determines skin colour. The gene comes in two versions, one of which is found in 99 per cent of Europeans. The other is found in 93 to 100 per cent of Africans, researchers at Pennsylvania State University report in the latest issue of Science. Scientists have changed the colour of a dark-striped zebra fish to uniform gold by inserting a version of the pigment   gene into a young fish. As with humans, zebra fish skin colour is determined by pigment cells, which contain melanosomes  . The number, size and darkness of melanosomes per pigment cell determines skin colour. It appears that, like the golden zebra fish, light-skinned Europeans also have a mutation  in the gene for melanosome production. This results in less pigmented skin. However, Keith Cheng, leader of the research team, points out that the mutation is different in human and zebra fish genes. Humans acquired dark skin in Africa about 1.5 million years ago to protect bodies from ultra-violet rays of the sun, which can cause skin cancer. But when modern humans leave Africa to live in northern latitudes, they need more sunlight on their skin to produce vitamin D. So the related gene changes, according to Cheng. Asians have the same version of the gene as Africans, so they probably acquired their light skin through the action of some other gene that affects skin colours, said Cheng. The new discovery could lead to medical treatments for skin cancer. It also could lead to research into ways to change skin colour without damaging it like chemical treatment done on Michael Jackson.

There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around but we can't detect them or sense them without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being outright by killing masses of cells in important organs. Even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no level of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and when they are killed outright. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They reproduce themselves in an unusual way. They can grow into cancer.

Humans have an internal clock that regulates  the beating of our heart, the pace of our breathing, the discharge  of chemicals within our bloodstream, and many other bodily functions. Time is something from which we can't escape. Even if we ignore it, it's still going by, ticking away, second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour. So the main issue in using your time well is, \"Who's in charge?\" We can allow time to slip by and let it be our enemy. Or we can take control of it and make it our _ . By taking control of how you spend your time, you'll increase your chances of becoming a more successful student.

He patrols  Seoul's bridges to stop desperate people from throwing themselves into the river. According to South Korea's health ministry, suicide rates have doubled in a decade and are now the leading cause of death for people in their 20s and 30s. The country has the fourth-highest suicide rate among the 30 industrialized countries in the Organization for Co-operation and Development (OECD). It recorded 22.8 suicide deaths for every 100,000 people in 2003. That's lower than Hungry, Finlandand close neighbourJapan. But the number is growing by about 1 percent each year, faster than for all other OECD nations. In a move to cut suicides by a fifth by 2010, the health ministry is running a television ad campaign. It opens with a lonely man walking on a bridge. A voice over says: \"Think five minutes more before you give it all away. Don't forget you have a loving family.\" Other ministry plans include setting up more hotlines and training more suicide counselors. Authorities are also limiting websites that provide suicide methods and sometimes even sell toxic  chemicals.     Distressed individuals range from students worried about poor grades to people in debt as well as disgraced politicians.     Experts say the rising toll  in some way can be blamed on media coverage of recent high-profile suicides. These include top business leaders and celebrities  who apparently lead a number of people to copy their actions.     \"We saved 50 lives this year when people turned to bridges as a place to die after news reports of such deaths by 'big shots',\" said the 38-year-oldYoo, in December.     Last July, the government and civil associations urged media to avoid reporting specific methods and locations of suicides. But it is difficult to clearly give reasons for the suicide increase. It doesn't say but implies that    .\nA.present hotlines are not enough for suicide counsellors\nB.people choose suicide as the way to end their lives because they are short of love\nC.cutting suicides by a fifth by 2010 is easy to carry out\nD.authorities manage websites efficiently\nAnswer:",

The fear that he saw in the eyes of that first dog-eventually replaced by gratitude and love-moved Grim so deeply that even at that young age he knew he had found his life's work. In 1998, Grim formed a nonprofit group called Stray Rescue. The group's goal: to save as many of St. Louis's stray dogs as possible. Today, Grim heads up an organization with a $3 million annual budget, a staff of more than 50 paid workers, thousands of volunteers, and a well-equipped shelter that houses as many as 200 dogs. The money that supports Stray Rescue has been raised through donations and through the force of Grim's outspoken advocacy . A man who sees himself as shy is anything but that when it comes to speaking out for dogs. The impact has been significant. While there are no good estimates as to the number of stray dogs on the streets of St. Louis, today 40% more dogs are being picked up off the streets than just two years ago, about 98% are now adopted into homes. Stray Rescue also funds a massive education campaign.

After improvising for a while, I started playing, still in the darkness.I heard the music through my skin.For the first time I didn't think about how it would sound to anyone else, and slowly, joyfully, gratefully, I started to hear again.The notes sang out, first like a trickle:, then like a fountain of cool water bubbling up from a hole in the middle of a desert.After an hour or so I looked up, and in the darkness saw the outline of the cat sitting on the floor in front of me, cleaning her paws and purring loudly, I had an audience again, humble as it was.

He didn't have food, water, a phone, or other supplies. He was getting colder by the minute. Gavin had no idea where he was. He tried not to panic. He thought about all of the survival shows he had watched on TV. It was time to put the tips he had learned to use. He decided to stop skiing. There was a better chance of someone finding him if he stayed put. The first thing he did was to find shelter from the freezing wind and snow. If he didn't, his body temperature would get very low, which could quickly kill him. Using his skis, Gavin built a snow cave. He gathered a huge mass of snow and dug out a hole in the middle. Then he piled branches on top of himself, like a blanket, to stay as warm as he could. By that evening, Gavin was really hungry. He ate snow and drank water from a nearby stream so that his body wouldn't lose too much water. Not knowing how much longer he could last, Gavin did the only thing he could -- he huddled   in his cave and slept. The next day, Gavin went out to look for help, but he couldn't find anyone. He followed his tracks and returned to the snow cave, because without shelter, he could die that night. On Tuesday, Gavin went out again to find help. He had walked for about a mile when a volunteer searcher found him. After two days stuck in the snow, Gavin was saved. Gavin might not have survived this snowstorm had it not been for TV. He had often watched Grylls' survival show Man vs. Wild. That's where he learned the tips that saved his life. In each episode   of Man vs. Wild, Grylls is abandoned in a wild area and has to find his way out. When Grylls heard about Gavin's amazing deeds, he was super impressed that Gavin had made it since he knew better than anyone how hard Gavin had to work to stay alive.

Sometimes, whales came so close to the ship that you thought you could easily touch them. While we were watching the whales, a guide was giving us some information about them. She told us that we saw only two kinds of whales -- 50-foot humpback whales (singing whales) and 70-foot fin back whales (the second largest whales on earth). She also said we could easily recognize a whale by its tail because every whale has a different kind of tail just like people have different fingerprints. They all have names, and on this trip, we saw \"Salt\" and \"Pepper\", two whales named by a biologist and a fisherman. They were swimming together all the time.

        "input":"Tornadoes are nature's most violent storms, which can cause deaths and destroy a neighborhood in seconds. A tornado appears as a funnel-shaped   cloud from a thunderstorm to the ground with whirling   winds that can reach 300 miles per hour. Damage paths can be over one mile wide and 50 miles long. Every state is at some risk from this disaster. Some tornadoes can be seen clearly, while rain or nearby low-hanging clouds _ others. At many times, tornadoes develop so rapidly that little, if any, advance warning is possible. Before a tornado hits, the air may become very still. A cloud of debris   can mark the location of a tornado even if a funnel can not be seen. Tornadoes generally occur near the edge of a thunderstorm, when the strong wind may die down. It is not uncommon to see clear, sunlit skies behind a tornado. The following are facts about tornadoes: The average forward speed of a tornado is 30 MPH, but may also vary from still to 70 MPH. Debris is picked up or a cloud forms in the funnel. The average tornado moves from southwest to northeast, but tornadoes have been known to move in any direction. Tornadoes are most often reported east of the Rocky Mountains during spring and summer months. Tornadoes can happen together with tropical storms and hurricanes as they move onto land. Waterspouts are tornadoes that form over water. The tornado season in the southern states of America is March through May; in the northern states, it is late spring through early summer. Tornadoes are most likely to occur between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m., but can occur at any time.

German weightlifter Matthias Steiner pulled ahead of Russian rival Evgeny Chigishev to win the Olympic men's +105 kg weightlifting gold medal on Tuesday. Steiner lifted a total of 461kg, 203kg in the snatch  and 258kg in the clean and jerk , to beat Chigishev by a single kilogram. The German won the battle of giants in his last lift, winning his country's first gold medal in the event at this year's Games. Steiner's winning lift was also the last effort of the sport for this Olympics at which China earned eight of the 15 golds. Steiner was born in Austria and represented his country of birth at the Athens Olympics four years ago, placing seventh in the lower 105kg category, but had a falling out with Austria's weightlifting federation afterwards. He applied for German citizenship in 2005 and got married, but his career went into deep freeze as he could not compete without a passport. He finally obtained the document last January. The German, who turns 26 on Monday, had come to these Games on a mission to win the title for his wife Susann, who died in a car accident in July last year. The German team said he used the personal tragedy to motivate himself to win the gold medal. Chigishev was the strongest in the snatch session Tuesday. He kissed his fists after a 210-kg lift that gave him a 7-kg advantage over fourth-placed Steiner going into the second event -- the clean and jerk. He let out a victorious roar after clearing 250 kg in his last lift, but the glory was short-lived as Steiner stunned everyone with his final, winning clean and jerk effort. Steiner had finished seventh in the 2004 Olympics in the 105kg weight category, and took the gold in the 2008 European Championship +105kg snatch competition, bronze in the clean and jerk and silver overall, with a total weight of 446kg.

Google knows that you might do something like that, and it also knows which state you're in if you are in the United States. Now, it's putting that information together in a tool that could find out flu outbreaks faster than traditional systems currently in use, according to CNN report. It is called Google Flu Trends.      \"What's exciting about Flu Trends is that it lets anybody---doctors, health officials, moms with sick children---learn about the current flu activity level in their own state based on the data that's coming in this week,\" said Jeremy Ginsberg, the lead engineer who developed the tool.      The tool operates on the idea that there's likely to be a flu outbreak in states where flu-related search terms are currently popular.      To test the accuracy of the data, Google compared its figures against statistics filed  over the past five years by the US Centers for Disease Control. It has a network of 1,500 doctors across the US who provide weekly reports on the number of patients complaining of flu-like symptoms.      \"We found we could highly accurately estimate what the flu activity levels would be in those years,\" Ginsberg said. They also found that the Google statistics, which can be gathered daily, were up to two weeks ahead of the government's data. The government's data took time to collect because it came from so many doctors.      The ability to speed up the response of health services could prove invaluable when a serious outbreak happens.      The results of Google's comparisons with official health statistics will be published in the science journal Nature.      Google hopes to extend the service to other countries, and may in time include other illnesses. At present, the flu data is given for each of the 50 American states.      The company says there are no privacy issues involved as the trends are gathered through combining millions of anonymous  searches.

It's an increasingly urgent question, given the recent mining accidents in Sago. W. Va. and Huntington, Utah. A small group of engineers and robotics experts look forward to a day in the not-too-distant future when robots and other technology do most of the dangerous mining work. Robotic technology, in particular, holds much promise, McAteer says, especially when it comes to mapping mines and rescuing trapped miners--the special operations of the mining industry. One of the first mining robots was developed five years ago at Canegie-Mellon University's Robotics Institute. It was called Groundhog. It used lasers to \"see\" in dark tunnels and map abandoned mines - some of the most dangerous work in the business The latest design is called Cave Crawler. It's a bit smaller than Grondhog, and even more advanced. It can take photos and video and has more sensors that can discover the presence of dangerous gases. The robot has a real sense of logic, which is hard to believe. If it comes across a thing in the way it gets confused. It has to think through the process and where to go next, and sometimes it _ just like a real person. The greatest problem, though, is cost. The money of the earliest research project was provided by the government, but that money has dried up, and it's not clear where future money will come from. Partly for that reason, and partly because of advances in safely, mining is not nearly as dangerous as it was in the past. Since 1990,fatalities  have declined by 67 percent and injuries by 51 percent, according to the National Mining Association. Some experts predict that robots in the mines will serve much of the same function that they do in the automotive industry. The robot do the most boring and dangerous jobs, but don't eliminate the need for human workers.

Americans are very direct people. When you want something you say \"Yes\" and when you don't, you say \"No\". If you want something different from what is offered, you ask for it. Westerners will not ask you again and again or try to press something on you after you have said you don't want it. In fact, if you say \"No\" when you really want something to drink or to eat, you may find yourself very thirsty or hungry. But there are a few Western customs which are very important and you should try at all times to observe.A Westerner doesn't leave his paper or cloth on the table. He puts it on his lap where it's supposed to protect his clothes from spilled food or uses it to wipe his hand or mouth when necessary. A Westerner doesn't put his own fork, knife or spoon into a serving bowl. He uses it in the bowl to put some of the food on his own plate, and then returns the serving fork(knife or spoon) to the bowl. A Westerner doesn't spit food anywhere. If he has bones in his mouth, he takes them out with his fingers and places them on the edge of his plate, never on the table or floor. A Westerner doesn't belch  out loud. If he does, he says \"Excuse me\" quietly and goes on with the conversation.

Much of the real significance of railroads and highways is not in their direct physical effect on the scenery, but in the ways that they affect the suurouding community. The same is true of big solar ppants and the power lines that will be laid dowm to move electricity around. The 19 century saw land grants offered to railroad companies to build the transcontinental railroads ,leaving public land in between privately owned land . In much of the west ,some of the railroad sections were developed while others remained undeveloped ,and in both cases the landownership has presented unique challenges to land management ,with the completion or the interstate highway system ,many of the small towns which sprang up as railway stops and developed well ,have lost their lifeblood and died . Big solar plants and their power lines will also have effects far beyond their direct footprint in the west .this is not an argument against building then ,we need alternative energy badly .and to really take advantage of it we need to be able to move electricity around far more readily than we can now . So trade-offs will have to be made .some scenic sport will be sacrificed .some species  will be forced to move ,or will be carefully moved to special accommodations ,deals will be struck to reduce the immediate effects . The lasting effects of these trade-offs are another matter .the 21 century development of the American west as an ideal place for alternative energy is going to throw off a lot of power and money to do a lot of good .but it is just as likely that they will be spent wastefully and will leave new problems behind ,just like the railroad and the highway .

But some parents are strongly against the idea. They can't see the advantages of students doing such chores  . They think that the school should provide students with a proper education, not the chance to be school cleaners. In fact, parents, schools and society play an equally  important role in developing the character of students. It is good for schools to give students such tasks,because few of the students will do them at home. Their parents want them to do homework only. In recent years, some parents will _ when students are asked to do some chores in schools. Some complain about the teachers if their kids get hurt in schools; some even challenge the schools' teaching methods and management. As a result, many primary schools, especially those in big cities, do not let students join in outdoor activities during breaks, fearing that they might get hurt. This is bad for the development of students' best qualities. What the primary school in Fuzhou is doing is worth praising.

        "input":"Seventeenth-century houses in colonial North American were simple structures that were primarily functional, carrying over traditional designs that went back to the Middle Ages.  During the first half of the eighteen century, however, houses began to show a new elegance.  As wealth increased, more and more colonist built fine houses.    Since architecture was not yet a specialized profession in the colonies, the design of buildings was left either to amateur   designers or to carpenters who were engaged in translating architectural handbooks imported from England.  Inventories of libraries shows an astonishing number of these handbooks for builders, and the houses built during the eighteenth century show their influence.  Nevertheless, most household architecture of the first-quarters of the eighteenth century displays a wide  _ of taste and freedom of application of the rules laid down in these books.    Increasing wealth and growing sophistication   throughout the colonies resulted in houses of improved design, whether the material was wood, stone, or brick.  New England still favored wood, though brick houses became common in Boston and other towns, where the danger of fire gave an impetus   to the use of more durable material.  A few houses in New England were built of stone, but only in Pennsylvania and areas nearby was stone widely used in buildings.  An increased use of brick in houses and outbuildings is noticeable in Virginia and Maryland, but wood remained the most popular material even in houses built by wealthy landowners.  In the Carolinas, even in closely packed Charleston, wooden houses were much common than brick houses.    Eighteenth-century houses showed great interior improvements over the former ones.  Windows were made larger and shutters removed.  Large, clear panes replaced the small leaded glass of the seventeenth century.  Doorways were larger and more decorative.    Fireplaces became decorative features of rooms.  Walls were made of plaster or wood.  White paint began to take the place of blues, yellows, greens, and lead color1s, which had been popular for walls in the earlier years.  After about 1730, advertisements for wallpaper styles in scenic patterns began to appear in colonial newspapers.

He walked down near the water -- the tide  was out -- and switched on the radio to listen to soft rock. Then he shoveled wet sand into a pile nearly four feet high and as many feet across. Then he created a square shape. After that, he set to work with palette knife, spatulas, and spoons. He shaped a splendid tower, topped walls, fashioned beautiful bay windows, and carved  out a big front gate. The man knew his sand. He smoothly finished some surfaces and carved artistic designs on others. As the shapes began to dry, he gently kept them slightly wet with water from the spray bottle, in case they might break in the wind. All this took hours. People gathered.

Sometimes these trips are difficult and full of hardships, but they're a lot of fun. One organization, Earth watch, sends small groups of volunteers to different parts of the world. Some volunteers spend two weeks and study the environment. Others work with animals. Others learn about people of the past. Would you like an adventure in the Far North? A team of volunteers is leaving from Mormons, Russia. The leader of this trip is a professor from Alaska. He's worried about chemicals from factories. He and the volunteers will study this pollution in the environment. If you like exercise and cold weather, this is a good trip for you. Volunteers need ski sixteen kilometers every day. Do you enjoy ocean animals? You can spend two to four weeks in Hawaii. There, you can teach language to dolphins. Dolphins can follow orders such as \"Bring me the large ball.\" They also understand opposites. How much more can they understand? It will be exciting to learn about these intelligent animals. Another study trip goes to Washington State and follows orcas. We call orcas \"killer Whale\", but they're really dolphins--the largest kind of dolphin. This beautiful animal travels together in family groups. They move through the ocean with their mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers. Ocean pollution is chasing their lives. Earth watch is studying how this happens. Are you interested in history? Then Greece is the place for your adventure. Thirty-five hundred years ago a volcano exploded there, on Santorum.

        "input":"Soccer is not a violent game. But players can hit the ball with their head to purposely change the direction of the ball. In the sport this move is known as a header. Unfortunately, they may sometimes crash into other players, the ground or goal posts. During the World Cup semifinal soccer match in Sao Paulo, Brazil, July 2014,Netherlands,Dirk Kuyt went for a header with Argentina's Javier Mascherano and Ezequiel Garay, making his competitors injured in head. Catherine McGill is a neuropsychologist  at the Children's National Health System in Houston. She examines many children who have suffered concussions  ,which are the most common brain injury. She says concussions from soccer and other youth sports are increasing. \"Firstly,parents, coaches, and medical providers alike are getting better at recognizing and responding to the injury, and it,s a huge proof to media paying more attention to this and leagues  paying more attention to the safety of their players. Also, kids are getting bigger, faster, stronger across the sports, and so more injuries may be occurring simply because of that.\" Catherine McGill spoke at a recent conference on ways to make soccer safer for young players which was held recently in New York. She says researchers are examining the effects of soccer-related head injuries. They want to know whether repeated hits to the head can cause CTE, which is a brain disorder that worsens as a person ages. She says parents often ask what age children should start \"heading\" or whether there should be \"heading\" at all. She thinks it,s a very individual decision. The age for one child may be quite different from another. What's the main purpose of the passage?\nA.To entertain us with exciting soccer matches.\nB.To warn us of something dangerous in sports.\nC.To inform us of risks of heading in soccer.\nD.To share ways to make soccer safer for children.\nAnswer:",

Gatty, 52, said he was forced to take such drastic action after he accidentally went into a crocodile-infested area of Queensland. He only had two meat sandwiches to keep him going, as crocodiles moved beneath his tree each night until his rescue. Gatty said he decided it was safer to hold out for a rescue team than try to make a run for it. His problems began after he fell off his horse while out in the northern Australia outback. Dazed and bleeding, he climbed back on his horse and hoped it would lead him home. It was only when he regained his senses he realized that he had been taken into crocodile-infested area. \"I had to get off the horse and I fell straight into a crocodile nest,\" he told reporters. \"That frightened me. I couldn't go back, it was too far and too dangerous, so I headed to the nearest high ground and stayed there, hoping someone would come and find me before the crocs did.\" Gatty explained how each night two crocodiles would sit at the bottom of the tree staring at him. Although Gatty's two sandwiches ran out after three days, he was able to get running water during the day and knew rescuers were looking for him as he could see helicopters in the air above his tree. \"If I hadn't seen the crocs circling me, and if I hadn't fallen into the croc nest, I would have made a push for it.

        "input":"Science is a dominant theme in our culture. Since it touches almost every aspect of our life, educated people need at least some idea of its structure and operation. They should also have an understanding of the subculture in which scientists live and the kinds of people they are. An understanding of general characteristics of science as well as specific scientific concepts is easier to obtain if one knows something about the things that excite and frustrate the scientist. This book is written for the intelligent student or lay   person whose knowledge of science is superficial; for the person who has been presented with science as a musty storehouse of dried facts; for the person who sees the chief objective of science as the production of small devices; and for the person who views the scientists as some sort of magician. The book can be used to supplement a course in any science, to accompany any course that attempts to give an understanding of the modern world, or independently of any course, simply to provide a better understanding of science. We hope this book will lead readers to a broader perspective on scientific attitudes and a more realistic view of what science is, who scientists are, and what they do. It will give them an awareness and understanding of the relationship between science and our culture and an appreciation of the roles science may play in our culture. In addition, readers may learn to appreciate the relationship between scientific views and some of the values and philosophies that are widespread in our culture. We have tried to present in this book an accurate and up-to-date picture of the scientific community and the people who populate it. That population has in recent years come to consist of more and more women. This increasing role of women in the scientific subculture is not an unique incident but, rather, part of the trend evident in all parts of society as more women enter traditionally male-dominated fields and make significant contributions. In discussing these changes and contribution, however, we are faced with a language that is somewhat sexist, one that uses male nouns or pronouns in referring to unspecified individuals. To balance this built-in bias  , we have adopted the policy of using plural nouns and pronouns whenever possible and , when absolutely necessary, alternating him and her. This policy is far from being ideal, but it is at least an acknowledgement of the inadequacy of our language in treating half of the human race equally. We have also tried to make the book entertaining as well as informative. Our approach is usually informal. We feel, as many other scientists do, that we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously. As the reader may observe, we see science as a delightful pastime rather than as a grim and dreary way to earn a living. The book mentioned in this passage is written for readers who   _  .\nA.are intelligent college students and lay person who do not know much about science.\nB.are good at producing various devices\nC.work in a storehouse of dried facts\nD.want to have a superficial understanding of science.\nAnswer:",

She studied hard and spent her free time coming up with ways to make money, including making food and selling it to friends. In 1987, when Banda was 24 years old, she decided to start her own restaurant. She borrowed a room and used food, and pans from her own kitchen.

After counting the money, she was surprised that she had made more in one day than most people make in one month. From that small restaurant, Banda built a large company called the Sylva Group. It now has hundreds of people working for it and is worth over a million dollars.

From day two (everyone wanted to walk the cute puppy that first day ) , neither thought to walk the dog .

Then one day -- January 1, 2007 , to be exact -- my husband ' s doctor uttered an unthinkable word : leukemia ( ) .With that , I spent eight to ten hours a day with Joe in the hospital , doing anything and everything I could to ease his discomfort. During those six months of hospitalizations, Becky, 12 at the time, adjusted to other adults being in the house when she returned from school. My work colleagues adjusted to my taking off at a moment's notice for medical emergencies. Every part of my life changed; no part of my old routine remained. Save one: Misty still needed walking. At the beginning, when friends offered to take her through her paces, I declined because I knew they had their own households to deal with.

Arthur von Wiesenberger, who carries the title Water Master, is one of the few water critics in North America. As a boy, he spent time in the larger cities of Italy, France and Switzerland, Where bottled water is consumed daily. Even then, he kept a water journal, noting the brands he liked best. \"My dog could tell the difference between bottled and tap water.\" He says.    But is plain tap water all that bad? Not at all. In fact, New York's municipal water for more than a century was called the champagne of tap water and until recently considered among the best in the world in terms of both taste and purity. Similarly, a magazine in England found that tap water from the Thames River tasted better than several leading brands of bottled water that were 400 times more expensive. Nevertheless, soft-drink companies view bottled water as the next battle-ground for market share-this despite the fact that over 25 percent of bottled water comes from tap water: PepsiCo's Aquafina and Coca-Cola's Dasani are both purified tap water rather than spring water. As diners thirst for leading brands, bottlers and restaurateurs salivate   over the profits. A restaurant's typical mark-up on wine is 100 to 150 percent, whereas on bottled water it's often 300 to 500 percent. But since water is much cheaper than wine, and many of the fancier brands aren't available in stores, most dines don't notice or care. As a result, some restaurants are turning up the pressure to sell bottled water. According to an article in The Street Journal, some of the more shameless tactics include placing attractive bottles on the table for a visual sell, listing brands on the menu without prices, and pouring bottled water without even asking the dinners if they want it. Regardless of how it's sold, the popularity of bottled water taps into our desire for better health, our wish to appear cultivated, and even a longing for lost purity.

Topics such as death, for example, were once considered so upsetting that it was a taboo to even talk about them. Now with the publication of important books such asOn Death and DyingandLearning to Say Goodbye, people have become more aware of the importance of expressing feelings about death and, as a result, are more willing to talk about this taboo subject.

The _ is thin, not fat. In the work world, most companies prefer youthful-looking, slim manager to sell their image as well as their products to the public.

        "input":"The Norwegian government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down(though these have already been raised) ; and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the government will be able to hold things back for long.  Ever since the war, the government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. For the past few years this program has had a great deal of success: Torso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern city could be in ruins.  The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 per cent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad.  The real argument over the oil industry is its effects on the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as real Norwegians. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most against the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the sea and to the countryside and to the whole country.  One Norwegian politician said last week, \"We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.\" Norwegian farmers and fishermen have an important effect because   _  .\nA.they form such a large part of Norwegian society\nB.their views of life and value agree with the Norwegian government's\nC.Norwegians respect them as representatives  of Norwegian culture\nD.they regard oil as harm to the Norwegian way of life\nAnswer:",

When I arrived at her house, I noticed that she had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that she had worn to celebrate her last wedding anniversary. She smiled from a face that was as beautiful as an angel's. We went to a very nice and comfortable restaurant. After we sat down, I had to read the menu. A smile was on her lips.\"It was I who used to have to read the menu when you -were a child,\" she said. \"Then it's time that you relax and let me return the favor,\" I responded. During the dinner we had an agreeable conversation-nothing special but catching up on recent events of each other's life. We talked so much that we missed the movie. As we arrived at her house later, she said,\"I'll go out with you again, but only if you let me invite you.\" I agreed. A few days later my mother died of an unexpected heart attack.

        "input":"Yawning sends out certain messages -either \"Oh,this movie is so boring\" or \"I probably need to get some sleep\". But did you know that a yawn can also help your brain to cool down when it is overheated? A new study, led by a research team at Princeton University, has indicated that yawning could be the brain's natural way of regulating temperature. People yawn more often when the temperature outdoors is lower than their body temperature but are less likely to yawn when it is hotter outdoors, according to Sciencedaily. com. The research team did an experiment on 160 people, 80 in summer and 80 in winter, to examine how often they yawned at different air temperatures. The study found that people yawned more often in winter than in summer. Scientists say that when the air temperature is lower outside the body, there is heat exchange between the overheated brain and the cool air. But when the air temperature is higher than or equal to the body, people are less likely to yawn because the hot air they breathe in will make the brain even hotter. When people yawn, their jaw is also stretched,which increases blood flow and may also help cool the brain The study showed that the amount someone yawned could be related to the amount of time they spent outside. The longer they spent outside in summer, the less they yawned. Nearly 40 percent of participants yawned within their first five minutes outside, but after that the percentage was reduced to less than 10 percent. However, the result was the opposite in winter. The number of people who yawned increased when they spent more than five minutes outdoors. But the change was only slight compared to summertime. According to Gallup, this is the first report to show that yawning frequencies change depending on season. This could help us to understand better the way our brains work. It may also help us understand the reason why frequent yawning can sometimes be a sign of brain disease.

English is among them. Scientists say that this sleep study method greatly speeds language learning. They say that the ordinary person can learn two or three times as much during sleep as in the same period during the day--and this does not affect   his rest in any way. However, sleep teaching will only put into your head what you have studied already while you are awake. In one experiment, ten lessons were broadcast over the radio for two weeks. Each lesson lasted twelve hours -- from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. The first three hours of English grammar and vocabulary   were given with the students awake. At 11 p.m. a lullaby   was broadcast to send the student to sleep and for the next three hours the radio in a soft and low voice broadcast the lesson again into his sleeping ears.

        "input":"We've all experienced a \"good cry\". Shedding   some tears can often make us feel better and help us put things in perspective. But why is crying beneficial? And is there such a thing as a \"bad cry\"? The researchers analyzed the detailed accounts of more than 3,000 recent crying experiences and found that the benefits of crying depend entirely on the what, where and when of a particular crying episode  . The majority of persons reported improvements in their mood following a short period of crying. However, one third reported no improvement in mood and a tenth felt worse after crying. Criers who received social support during their crying episode were the most likely to report improvements in mood. Research to date has not always produced a clear picture of the benefits of crying, in part because the results often seem to depend on how crying is studied. The researchers note several challenges in accurately studying crying behavior in a laboratory setting. Volunteers who cry in a laboratory setting often do not describe their experiences as making them feel better. Rather, crying in a laboratory setting often results in the study participants feeling worse;  this may be due to the stressful conditions of the study itself, such as being videotaped or watched by researchers. This may produce negative emotions, which neutralize   the positive benefits usually connected with crying. However, these laboratory studies have provided interesting findings about the physical effects of crying. Criers do show calming effects such as slower breathing, but they also experience a lot of unpleasant stress, including increased heart rate and sweating. What is interesting is that bodily calming usually lasts longer than the unpleasant. The calming effects may occur later and overcome the stress reaction, which would account for why people tend to remember mostly the pleasant side of crying. Research has shown that the effects of crying also depend on who is shedding the tears. For example, individuals with anxiety or mood disorders are least likely to experience the positive effects of crying. In addition, the researchers report that people who lack insight into their emotional lives actually feel worse after crying. Who will be least likely to feel worse after crying?\nA.People who receive help in course of crying.\nB.People who fail to understand their emotions.\nC.People who are anxious and nervous.\nD.People whose mood is not in order.\nAnswer:",

Some people cannot use their arms or hands to do simple jobs because they have been hurt or are sick. Usually they depend on other people to help them. This problem made two women think about how they could help people who cannot do everyday things for themselves. In 1979 Dr. M. J. Willard and Judi Zazula began looking at some small, friendly monkeys called capuchin monkeys. These monkeys have hands like people's hands, and they like to be around people. Could the monkeys be trained to do things that people could not do for themselves? The women wanted to find out if their idea would work. So they spent a long time training some capuchin monkeys, and they found that these animals made great helpers. Today the first step in training a young capuchin monkey is to have it stay home with people and watch how they live. The monkeys learn how to _ around people. Then the monkeys go to a special school in Boston. There they learn how to do many easy chores. They are taught how to carry food and pick up dropped objects. They learn how to open doors and turn light switches on and off. They even learn how to use CD players and VCRs. After a monkey finishes its training, it goes to live with a person who needs help. If the person wants a light turned on, the monkey does it. If the person needs a glass of water, the monkey brings it. If the person wants to watch TV, the monkey turns it on. The monkey becomes a very important part of that person's life. In fact, the monkey often becomes the person's good friend.

In fact, over obesity has reached such proportions that one big-city mayor has gone about banning large-sized, sugary soft drinks and the First Lady has been on a campaign to control the dietary offerings in public schools. Even many adults who do not fit the clinic definition of obesity are still overweight, and a large percentage are looking for the best ways to lose weight. Reducing pounds largely comes down to the two-sided factors of diet and exercise. Not carrying out the first one enough, and not getting enough of the second one, ends up giving the individual a recipe for being overweight. Advising someone to eat less and exercise more might be the easiest advice possible, but it's also, partially, an oversimplification. Dieting has more to do with the types of food you eat than how much you eat. Reduce the amount of red meat in your diet. If you don't want to eliminate red meat altogether, choose cuts of meat with less fat content. Limit your intake of salt and starches. If you've got to have potato chips alongside your sandwich at lunch, choose the baked potato chips that contain less fat than the deep-fried chips. You might find you're really not sacrificing that much in terms of taste. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, egg whites, fish and nonfat dairy products will certainly aid in the mission of losing weight. Drink more water and less sugary drinks. If you have to have a soda, a diet soda is a better option, but seltzer is an even better choice than that. It's important--if not always easy--to make sure you get at least some physical activity each and every day. If your feet won't allow for a regular jogging regimen, then make sure you take lots of walks. Next time you need to mail a letter, walk to the mailbox instead of driving.

The next important date in the history of photography was 1837. That year, Daguerre, another Frenchman, took a picture of his studio. He used a new kind of camera and a different processs. In his pictures, you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest details. This kind of photograph was called a daguerreotype. Soon, other people began to use Daguerre's process. Travellers brought back daguerreotypes from all around the world. People photographed famous buildings, cities and mountains. In about 1840, the process was improved. Now photographers could take pictures of people and moving things. The process was not simple. The photographers had to carry lots of film and processing equipment. But this did not stop the photographers, especially in the United States, where from the 1840s daguerreotype artists were popular in most cities. Mathew Brady was a well-known American photographer. He took many pictures of famous people. The pictures were unusual because they were very life-like and full of personality. Brady was also the first person to take pictures of war. His 1862 Civil War pictures showed dead soldiers and ruined cities. They made the war seem more real and more terrible In the 1880s, new inventions began to change photography. Photographers could buy film readymade in rolls. So they did not have to make the film immediately. They could bring it back to their studios and develop it later, meaning that they did not have to carry lots of equipment. And finally, the invention of the small handheld camera made photography less expensive. With the small camera, anyone could be a photographer. People began to use cameras just for fun. They took pictures of their families, friends and favourite places. They called these pictures \"snapshots\". Photographs became very popular in newspapers in the 1890s. Soon magazines and books also used documentary photographs. These pictures showed true events and people. They were much more real than drawings.

Soon enough, help from other countries flew there for one purpose, \"saving lives\". Nowadays wherever an earthquake strikes, other countries are ready to send help. That is really something that, as human beings, we should be proud of.     When the earthquake struck, I was living in my hometown of Ankara, capital of the Turkey. Despite the 220-mile distance between the two locations, we still were able to feel the shakes.     I had a chance to visit Golcuk a couple times when I was a kid. My uncle who lives in Germany has a summer house there, and every summer they stay in Golcuk for their yearly vacation. After the quake struck, we couldn't contact them, so we didn't know if they were in Golcuk or in Germany during the quake. Our unsuccessful attempts worried us, and the only thing we wanted to hear was that they were OK. Without wasting any more time, my brother, my sister's husband, and I decided to drive there to check on them by ourselves.     When we were driving, the damage of the earthquake started to show itself right away. Big, wide, tall trees were laid down on the side of the road. Getting closer to Golcuk, we found the impact of the earthquake was getting worse. Inside the town was total destruction.     It wasn't easy to figure out the streets among the ruins. Finally, we were able to find my uncle's apartment and thank God, it was still standing, but nobody was there. Later on we found that they hadn't yet visited Golcuk that year. What luck!     Earthquakes are natural disasters and there is no way to avoid them, especially as earthquakes never give a warning in advance.

Since 2000, the CDC has made efforts with goals of getting 75% of Americans to eat two or more servings of fruit a day and 50% of Americans to eat three or more servings of vegetables a day. Unfortunately, Americans aren't meeting these modest targets. Although a diet high in fruit and vegetables can reduce the risk of many diseases, Americans just aren't getting enough. In fact, since 2000, the amount of vegetables Americans are eating has stayed the same and the amount of fruit Americans are eating has gone down. The CDC also finds that only about a third of adults are eating their expected servings of fruit, and just over a quarter of adults are eating their expected servings of vegetables. So why aren't Americans getting their expected servings of fruit and vegetables? It turns out that Americans might be spoiled when it comes to their produce. A national survey conducted by Fruit2day reveals that nearly half of Americans leave fruit in their fridges until it rots with people in Boston among the worst and those in New York and Los Angeles among the best. Sadly, most Americans admit to leaving fruit in the fridge for more than a week. There are many reasons why Americans don't eat their fruit or vegetables, including the inconvenience of having to wash or peel it. Fruit2day offers consumers a surprising and convenient way to enjoy the goodness of fruit. \"With no added sugar, natural juices and two full servings of fruit, our Fruit2day line has really captured the imaginations of health-conscious consumers who are actively looking to get more fruit in their diets,\" said Hanno Holm, president and chief executive officer of Hero-White Wave. \"Fruit2day makes getting more fruit in one's diet easier for any daily snack routine.\" For 4 million American adults, how many of them are eating two or more servings of fruit a day?\nA.About 1.3 million.\nB.About 2 million.\nC.About 3 million.\nD.About 1 million.\nAnswer:",

But Mr.Nicoletti, a 30-year-old consultant in Denver, insists that the glasses, which can block certain wavelengths of light emitted by electronic screens, make it easier to sleep. Studies have shown that such light, especially from the blue part of the spectrum  , _ the body's production of melatonin ,which helps people fall asleep. Options are growing for blocking blue light, though experts caution that few have been adequately tested for effectiveness and the best solution remains avoiding brightly lit electronics at night. A Swiss study of 13 teenage boys, published in August inThe Journal of Adolescent Healthshowed that when the boys wore orange-colored glasses, also known as 'blue blockers' and shown to prevent melatonin, in the evening for a week, they felt \"significantly more sleepy\" than when they wore clear glasses.The boys looked at their screens, as teenagers tend to do, for at least a few hours on average before going to bed, and were monitored in the lab. Older adults may be less affected by blue light, experts say, but blue light remains a problem for most people, and an earlier study of 20 adults aged 18 to 68 found that those who wore orange-colored glasses for three hours before bed improved their sleep quality considerably relative to a control group that wore yellow-colored lenses, which blocked only ultraviolet  light. LEDs used in devices such as smart phones, tablets and televisions tend to emit more blue light than incandescent products . LEDs are also increasingly popular as room lights, but \"warm white\" bulbs, with less blue, tend to be a better choice than \"cool white\" for nighttime use. The lighting company Philips also makes a reduced-blue LED bulb, meant to be used before bedtime.\"In theory, anything that will decrease that blue light exposure at night will be helpful.\" said Christopher Colwell, a scientist at the UCLA, \"I know some gainers who swear by those orange-colored glasses.\" But orange glasses are not a panacea . Dr. Skene said.\"It isn't just getting rid of the blue and everything's fine,\" she said. The intensity of light, in addition to color, can affect sleep, she said, and not all brands of orange-colored glasses have undergone enough independent testing for their ability to aid sleep. During the daytime, experts say, exposure to blue light is good. Best of all is sunlight, which contains many different wavelengths of light.\"That's what our brain knows,\" said Kenneth P.Wright Jr., director of the sleep and chronobiology  lab at the University of Colorado, Boulder. A 2013 study he led, published in the journalCurrent Biology, showed just how different things can be without nighttime lights. After participants had camped in the mountains for a week, their bodies began to prepare for sleep about two hours earlier than normal. Short of cutting out all evening electronics, experts say, it's advisable to use a small screen rather than a large one; dim the screen and keep it as far away from the eyes as possible; and reduce the amount of time spent reading the device. \"If you can look at the iPhone for 10 minutes rather than three hours, that makes a lot of difference,\" Dr.Skene said. Which of the following statements is true?\nA.The older a person is, the less he or she will be affected by blue light.\nB.The exposure to the blue light does nothing but harm to the human body.\nC.Traditional lighting companies are facing a dead end due to backward technology.\nD.All brands of orange-colored glasses are not reliable for their ability to aid sleep.\nAnswer:",

Located 56 miles from Copper Harbor on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the park remains _ that can only be reached by tour boat. With the exception of the Rock Harbor Lodge, which offers both rooms with private baths and accommodations in the form of small cottages, the 572,000 acres that make up the 45-mile-long park are rough, threaded with hiking paths that lead to tents-only campsites. You are likely to see a deer crossing mist-covered ponds in search of breakfast, gaze bald eagles flying overhead, or hear a beaver  clapping its tail on the water. If you are especially lucky, you might even glimpse a grey wolf, nearly dying out from hunting on the mainland. Plenty of hiking paths open the area to exploration. The 4-mile Stroll Path winds through various trees and offers a tour of the island's history, including prehistoric Indian mines. The Jungle Path leads to Scoville Point----a perfect picnic spot surrounded on three sides by the shining waters of Lake Superior. You can also rent a boat at the park's service center and row down the shore to the Rock Harbor Lighthouse. Here park's service employees use nets to show how lake fishes used to be caught by the original local people. Their catch ends up on the dinner menu at the Rock Harbor Lodge. The park is open from mid-April through October; Rock Harbor Lodge is open from Memorial Day weekend until just after Labor Day.

But what's more surprising is that many of those surveyed self-identified themselves as 'ugly' Americans and the world's worst travelers. Those in the U.S. ranked themselves as the worst travellers by a shocking 20 per cent, followed by 15 per cent saying the Chinese were the most substandard tourists. Americans topped the list as being the worst-behaved travelers in a survey of 5,600 respondents, 4,000 of whom were Americans. Other respondents were in Australia, Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. But even American respondents considered their compatriots  as the worst travelers from a list of 16 nationalities. Canadians and Australians also put Americans in the No. 1 spot. Irish respondents pointed to U.K. residents and U.K. respondents gave Germans the nod. On the other hand, 37% of Americans opted for \"none of the above\" in answer to the worst-tourists question, displaying more tolerance and open-mindedness than the other nationalities. Other survey questions had respondents admitting _ from hotels. Four in ten U.S. survey-takers said they'd stolen something - mostly towels (28%) and bathrobes (8%). Other popular pinched items included pillows, remote controls, Bibles and sheets. Not surprising is that Americans have less time off from work than other nationalities. Americans reported getting 16 days off, compared with 28 days for the Irish, 27 days for Australians, 23 days for U.K. workers; and 21 days for Canadians.

Sound has a waste product, too, in the form of noise. Noise has been called unwanted sound. Noise is growing and it may get much worse before it gets any better. Scientists, for several years, have been studying how noise affects people and animals and are alarmed by what they have learned. Peace and quiet are becoming harder to find. Noise pollution is no joke. It is a threat that should be looked at carefully. Sound is measured in units called decibels  . At a level of 140 decibels people feel pain in their ears. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, airplanes, boats, and factories all make noise. This noise bothers not only our ears, but our minds and bodies as well. There is a saying about \"it is so noisy that you can't hear yourself think\". Doctors who study noise believe that we must be able to hear ourselves think most of the time.

        "input":"There is a lot of misunderstanding about studying. Most students have not been taught the principles behind really effective working. Imagine a graph showing the amount a person learns against the number of hours he works in a day. If he doesn't do any work, he learns nothing (point 0). If he does an hour's work he learns a certain amount (point 1). If he does two hours' work he learns about twice as much (point 2). If he does more work he'll learn still more (point 3). However, if he tries to do twenty-three and a half hours' work in a day, he will be so tired that he'll hardly remember anything: what he learns will be very little (point 4). If he did less work he'd learn more (point 5). Now whatever the exact shape of the graph's curve , made by joining these points, it must have a high point. Point \"X\" is the very maximum anyone can learn in the day. And this represents the optimum , the best, amount of work to do. It is the best possible compromise between adequate time at the books and fatigue . Fatigue is an absolutely real thing; one can't escape it or ignore it. If you try to ignore it and press yourself to work past the optimum, you will only get on this downward slope and achieve less than the best - and then become very tired and lose your power of concentration. The skill in being a student consists of getting one's daily study as near the optimum point as possible. I cannot tell you what the optimum is. It differs with the type of work, it differs from person to person, and even in the same person it varies from week to week. You must try to find your own. Every day you study, bear this principle of the optimum in mind. When you feel yourself getting fatigued, if you find yourself reading the same paragraph over and over again and not taking it in, that's a pretty good sign you've reached your highest point for the day and should stop. Most ordinary students find their optimum at five hours a day. Yours may be a little more or a little less - but if you get in five hours' good work a day, you will be doing well. Now, what are you doing with yourself when you aren't working? Before examinations some students do nothing at all except sit in a chair and worry. Here is another misunderstanding. People often think that the mind works like the body; it does not. If one wanted to save one's physical energy in order to cut the maximum amount of firewood, one would lie flat on a bed and rest when one wasn't chopping. But the mind cannot rest. Even in sleep you dream, even if you forget your dreams. The mind is always turning. It gets its relaxation only by variety. That is what makes the mind rest. When you've finished your optimum number of hours you must stop. You must not then sit around in the chair thinking about the work - that only tires without any learning. You must get out and do something. It doesn't matter what - anything so long as you are actively doing something else but work. The only way the mind can relax is by   _  .\nA.doing a variety of things in turn\nB.not thinking about anything\nC.turning continuously\nD.getting oneself in a state of fatigue\nAnswer:",

His accuracy, observed in 25 cases, has led the staff to call family members once he has chosen someone. It usually means the patient has less than four hours to live. \"Many family members take some comfort from it. They appreciate the companionship that the cat provides for their dying loved one,\" said Dosa, a doctor and assistant professor of medicine at Brown University. The 2-year-old cat was adopted as a kitten and grew up in a third-floor dementia   unit at the Steere House Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, where the facility treats people with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease and other illnesses. After about six months, the staff noticed Oscar would make his own rounds, just like the doctors and nurses. He'd smell and observe patients, then sit beside people who would end up dying in a few hours. Dosa said Oscar seems to take his work seriously.  \"Oscar is better at predicting death than the people who work here,\" said Dr. Joan Teno of Brown University, who treats patients at the nursing home and is an expert on care for the terminally ill. She was convinced of Oscar's talent when he made his 13th correct call. While observing one patient, Teno said she noticed the woman wasn't eating, was breathing with difficulty and that her legs had a bluish color1, signs that often mean death is near. Oscar wouldn't stay inside the room, though, so Teno thought  _ . Instead, it turned out the doctor's prediction was roughly 10 hours too early. Sure enough, during the patient's final two hours, nurses told Teno that Oscar joined the woman at her bedside. Doctors say most of the people who get a visit from the sweet-faced, gray-and-white cat are so ill that they probably don't know he's there, so patients aren't aware he's a predictor of death. Most families are grateful for the advance warning.  No one's certain if Oscar's behavior is scientifically significant or points to a cause. Teno wonders if the cat senses mysterious scents or reads something from the behavior of the nurses who raised him.

        "input":"According to US research, it can take up to ten years to become a near-native English speaker. Asian and Spanish students took between five and ten years to reach native speaker performance in English-only schools. Fluency obviously doesn't happen overnight. But time can definitely make you a better speaker. After testing his own memory, German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered that humans forget most of what they learn in the first 20 minutes. So cramming right before a speaking exam is not likely to be as effective as practicing regularly over time. The more you practice, the more familiar new words will become. In the classroom, studies have also shown that repeating oral tasks improves a speaker's performance. One of the best repetition exercises is the 4\/3\/2 technique. Speakers give the same talk to three different listeners with a progressive decrease in delivery time, starting at four minutes, then three, and finally two minutes. This exercise has been proven to help learners speak faster. It can also result in less hesitation and more grammatical accuracy. While time dose make a difference when it comes to speaking perfect English, it would not hurt to brush up on your other language skills. Studies have also shown that reading can increase your speaking vocabulary. After one month of an extensive reading program, a 27-year-old student of French became more familiar with 65 percent of the new words. Aside from choosing the right learning methods, having certain personality traits may also help. US Stephen Krashen believes those with high motivation, self-confidence and a low level of anxiety are better equipped for speaking success.

Throughout the country,the general requirements  for butterfly gardening are the same:full sun,nectar source plants,larval    host plants,a pesticidefree environment,and knowledge of the local butterfly  species.Many butterflyattracting plants are natives and require little attention,as they are naturally adapted to the region in which they live. Butterfly gardens are best planted in spring with younger plants or in fall with mature plants that will become dormant quickly and reemerge in  spring.It is best not to plant in the heat of summer or the cold of winter. One of the most common mistakes in butterfly gardening is planting only one nectar source.Adult butterflies have a very short lifespan.Planting a variety of nectar sources will encourage more butterflies to visit the garden.Planting an adequate supply of host plants gives butterflies a place to lay their eggs,which will successfully hatch   and result in butterflies that will continue to visit the garden. Butterflies typically lay their eggs in late spring and hatch 3-6 days after they are laid.It takes 3-4 weeks for a caterpillar to pupate   and 9-14 days to emerge as an adult.

She followed Zeus to the earth to find out what he was doing and Zeus asked Echo to distract Hera until he could escape. Later when Hera discovered she had been tricked, she became very angry. She turned on Echo and said, \"You shall lose the use of your tongue because you cheated me. You'll have the last word, bur no longer have the power to speak first.\" So from that moment on, Beautiful Echo was hardly able to hold a conversation because she could only repeat the last words of those around her. She became very embarrassed and hid herself deep in the woods. One day a handsome young man called Narcissus came into the woods. He had been hunting deer and lost his way. However, the moment Echo saw him, she fell in love with him. She followed him, wishing to tell him but unable to begin a conversation. Oh, how she wished she could speak first. Unfortunately, Narcissus was far too busy worrying about where his companions might be and how he could find his way home. Eventually Narcissus, with Echo following behind along, came to a pool of water in the middle of the woods. Feeling thirsty, Narcissus bent down to drink. As he did so, he saw a beautiful creature in the water staring up at him. He immediately bent over and said to him, \"I love you!\" Echo, nearby, and seeing her chance, immediately responded \".... I love you!\" But it was too late. Narcissus was already in love, with himself. The stranger seemed to rise up closer to Narcissus who was so involved that he entirely failed to notice Echo. \"I want to stay and look at this beautiful sight forever,\" he whispered dreamily to himself.\"... Forever,\" repeated Echo sadly. \"Come here,\" called Narcissus to his reflection as he moved his head and the creature seemed to move away. \"...Here.\" responded Echo. Narcissus bent back down to see his reflection more clearly. \"So beautiful! I've never seen anything so beautiful!\" \"....So beautiful!\" responded Echo truthfully. Narcissus remained by the water refusing all Echo's silent offers of food and drink until he died. Where he had been, a flower grew in his place, as beautiful as Narcissus himself. As for Echo, from that time forward, she also didn't eat or drink till she turned to rocks and all that was left was her voice. Even now you can still hear Echo trying to attract Narcissus' attention by repeating his words and still see Narcissus as a beautiful flower growing near a pool. Why was Echo unable to let Narcissus know she loved him?\nA.Because she had lost the ability to speak.\nB.Because she was too shy to speak first.\nC.Because Narcissus took no notice of her.\nD.Because Hera had taken away her ability to speak first.\nAnswer:",

        "input":"\"Mind your own business.\" we're told.\"Don't talk about others behind their backs.\"The problem with this advice is that,not only is it unrealistic,it's also counterproductive . Common sense holds that gossip hurts people's feelings and damages relationships.But recent research shows the opposite--that strong communities and relationships between people would be impossible without gossip. Gossip is a way for people to let you know the limits of social behavior.\"If you move into a community and your neighbor tells you how the former homeowner never dealt with his rubbish properly,his gossip is letting you in on something,\"says Dr.Ralph Rosnow of Temple University.\"Gossip says:these are the boundaries and you are crossing them.You're not _ the rules and you'd better get back in line.\" Seen this way,gossip is a way to communicate criticism without conflict ,giving you a chance to change your behavior without losing face. On the other hand,what about ill-willed gossip,the kind that puts other people down? Gossip is hearing something we like about someone we don't and,in nearly every country in the world,gossip magazines have huge numbers of readers.According to researchers,however,this kind of gossip also has a good side because it helps us put our own problems in perspective .\"If we read bad news about well-known people,or get the frightful details of our neighbors' bad situation over a cup of coffee,our own problems begin to pale in comparison ,\"says Dr.Jack Levin of Northeastern University. However,that doesn't mean that gossip is necessarily a good thing,either.Researchers found that people who gossip a lot tend to feel like they're under a lot of stress.This might be because while they're busy talking about other people,they're also busy thinking what other people are saying about them. It could be learned from the passage that  _  .\nA.people under much stress enjoy gossiping about others.\nB.in a way gossip helps us deal with our own problems.\nC.in fact most people tend to believe gossip.\nD.the more there is gossip, the stronger relationships become between people.\nAnswer:",

As I was not experienced in cooking, I thought if a dozen was good, two dozen would be better, so I doubled everything. As Dong loved oranges, I also opened a can of orange and poured it all into the bowl. Soon there was a sticky dough   covered with ugly yellowish marks. realizing I had been defeated, I put the dough in the rubbish bin outside so I wouldn't have to face Doug laughing at my work, I went on preparing the rest of the meal, and, when Doug got home , we sat down to Cornish chicken with rice . He tried to enjoy the meal but seemed disturbed. Twice he got up and went outside, saying he thought he heard a noise. The third time he left, I went to the windows to see what he was doing. Looking out, I saw Doug standing about three feet from the rubbish bin, holding the lid up with a stick and looking into the container.

        "input":"The opening scene of The King's Speech was, in a word, terrifying. The moment King George VI--wonderfully played by Colin Firth--stepped up to the microphone at Wembley Stadium, a rush of nervousness came over me. It took me back to my school days, standing at my desk, having to read aloud to the class. I whispered to my wife, Jill, \"A stutterer  wrote this screenplay . I grew up with a stutter, really afraid of trying to get through simple sentences--knowing that I would then, or later, be laughed at. I still remember the reading when I was in 7thgrade at St. Helena's: \"Sir Walter Raleigh was a gentlemen...\" I remember reciting, \"Sir Walter Raleigh was a gentlemen.\" The school teacher said, \"Master B-B-B-Biden! What's that word?\" She wanted me to say gentlemen. But by then, I had learned to put my sentences into bite-size pieces and I was reading it: \"gentle\"|breath|\"man\". Ninety-nine percent of the time, the teachers were great. I never had professional treatment but a couple of teachers taught me to put a regular rise and fall in my tone of speaking, and that's why I spent so much time reading poetry. But even in my small, boys' prep school, I got _ in my class with the nickname Joe Stutterer. You get so desperate, you're so embarrassed. I actually went and stood by the side of my house once, with a small round stone in my mouth, and tried to talk. Jill always thought I was kidding until she saw the movie and saw King George did the same thing. King George relied on the support his wife and the help of Lionel Longue, who, in describing working with other stutterers, said, \"My job was to give them confidence in their voices and let them know that a friend was listening.\" I was lucky enough to have more than a couple of Lionels in my life. Nobody in my family ever--ever--made fun of me or tried to finish my sentences. My mother would say, \" _ .\" And because of her and others, I made sure it didn't. Through hard work and determination, I beat my stutter in high school. I even spoke briefly at my graduation ceremony in 1961--the most difficult speech of my life. My fight against shyness and embarrassment at my early age has developed my ability to understand others' feelings as Vice President of the country in public life. I still mark up all of my speeches the say way Firth's character does in the movie, pencil-marking every line to remind myself to stop, to breathe, to pause--to beat back my stuttering as best as I can. I don't stutter anymore, and most people who know me only late in my life are shocked that I ever did. By capturing exactly how a stutter feels, The King's Speech has shown millions of people how much courage it takes for a stutterer to stand up and speak. Equally important, it has shown millions who suffer from the pain that it can be overcome, we are not alone, and with the support of those around us, our deepest fears can be conquered. What message is conveyed in the passage?\nA.Whatever pain and fear we have, we can defeat them if we try hard.\nB.The similar stories of the writer and King George VI gains great admiration.\nC.The suffer we had at our early age will have a heavy influence on our future life.\nD.Stuttering is such a pain for children that we should give help and encourage them.\nAnswer:",

However, I still feel the festive atmosphere in my family. Each year, I attend not just one Thanksgiving dinner, but typically between three and four. Thanksgiving lasts all throughout the second half of the week. I travel to different houses to spend time with different parts of my family. We usually eat a giant amount of traditional Thanksgiving foods such as deviled eggs, ham, green beans, potatoes, and breads. We don't eat the traditional turkey like many families do, but we have just about everything else that someone would want to eat. After eating, we sit around and chat. Usually someone has brought a guest, such as a new boyfriend\/girlfriend or a new baby, so there's always a chance to get to know the new family member, as well as catching up with family that I haven't seen for a long time. My extended families are very different, which makes for different holiday experiences. My other's family is very polite and quiet, and that makes the dinner with them seem very formal. My father's family is the opposite. They're loud and don't even try to control what words come out of their mouths. Their Thanksgiving usually includes yelling at whatever football game is on the television. It's very casual and relaxed. Either way, it's nice to be able to see my family and spend time with them.

A tragedy comes about because a human's potential has never been realized. A tragedy comes about because a spark was snuffed out before it ever became a flame. By virtue of inhabiting a body we accept these risks. We expose our mortal flesh to the laws of the physical environment around us. The trade-off isn't so bad when you think about it.

However, the study author Dr Michael A.McDaniel of the Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond emphasized that these findings represent a general trend, and people with small heads should not automatically believe they are less intelligent. For instance, Albert Einstein's brain was \"not particularly large\", McDaniel noted. \"There's some relationship between brain size and intelligence on the average, but there's plenty of room for exceptions,\" he said. Interest in the relationship between brain size and intelligence grew in the1830s,  when German anatomist  Frederich Tiedmann wrote that he believed there was \"an unquestionable connection between the size of the brain and the mental energy displayed by the individual man\". Since that statement, scientists have conducted numerous studies to determine if Tiedmann's  assertion was, in fact, correct. Most studies have looked into the link between head size and intelligence. More recently, however, researchers have published additional studies on brain size and intelligence, measured using MRI scan . For his study, McDaniel analyzed more than 20 studies that looked into the relationship between brain size and intelligence in a total of 1,530 people. The studies showed that on the average, people with larger brain volume tended to be more intelligent. The relationship between brain volume and intelligence was stronger in women than men, and in adults than in children. McDaniel notes in the journal Intelligence. McDaniel is not sure why the relationship was stronger for adults and women. \"Other research has shown that women, on the average, tend to have smaller brains than men, but score just as well--if not higher--in tests of intelligence,\" he said. McDaniel insisted that the relationship between brain size and intelligence is not a \"perfect\" one. \"One can certainly find lots of examples of smaller-sized people who are highly intelligent,\" he said, \"But, on the average, the relationship holds.\" After Frederich Tiedmann wrote his article,  _  .\nA.many scientists agreed with him\nB.numerous studies have failed to prove his idea\nC.MRI scan became popularly used\nD.lots of researchers were interested in the connections between head size and intelligence\nAnswer:",

When the researchers recorded the locations of these bee populations, they found that many of the 67 species analyzed were moving northward from their southern limits while the northern edges of the bees' ranges are staying in place. What it results in is obvious. Bees have been paid more attention to in recent years, with populations of honeybees and bumblebees obviously declining in some parts of Europe. Previously, attention on the decline of bee populations has focused on causes including habitat loss, pesticide use and the spread of bee parasites . But the work by Kerr's team found something different. \"For every species, there is one or two species declining and others that are not moving at all,\" says Kerr. This shift has also been observed in other species, such as butterflies. But due to a new cause -- the rise of temperatures instead of total pesticide use, a change in land use or parasites, bumblebees -- unlike butterflies -- have failed to extend the northern boundaries of their ranges into the territory that is now habitable for them, so bumblebee species across Europe and North America are declining rapidly, the latest study led by Kerr's team finds. \"Our data suggest that the new factor plays a leading, or perhaps the leading, role in this trend,\" says Kerr. \"This study shows that a fourth factor is also beginning to affect it. It is likely that the combined stresses from all of these pressures will have destructive impacts on bumblebees in the not-too-distant future,\" says Dave Goulson, a bee researcher at the University of Sussex, Brighton, UK. Exactly what can be done to help bumblebees is not clear.

But the same might be said about almost any of the expressways that have become an important part of American city life--and about the heavy traffic that often blocks them. In Chicago, a computerized system has been developed that controls traffic on the city's seven expressways. Now one man--a controller--can follow the movement of Chicago's traffic by looking at a set of lights. The system uses electronic sensors that are built into each expressway, half a mile apart. Several times a second, the computer receives information from each sensor and translates it into green, yellow, or red lights on a map in the control room. A green light means the traffic is moving forty-five miles an hour, yellow means thirty to forty-five miles an hour and red means heavy  traffic--cars standing still or moving less than thirty miles an hour. \"See that red light near Austin Avenue?\" the controller asked a visitor. \"That's a repair truck fixing the road, and the traffic has to go around it\". At the Roosevelt Roadentrance to the expressway, the light kept changing from green to red and back to green again. \"A lot of trucks get on the expressway there,\" the controller explained. \"They can't speed up as fast as cars.\" The sensors show immediately where an accident or a stopped car is blocking traffic, and a truck is sent by radio to clear the road. The system has lowered the number of accidents by 18 percent.

When a cat is frightened, its heart starts beating faster, its muscles get tense, and there are changes in the chemicals in its bloodstream.Although the cat doesn't realize this, its body is getting ready for action.If the danger continues, the animal will do one of two things.It will defend itself, or it will run away as fast as it can. Something like this also happens to people.When we are excited, angry, scared, or aroused by other emotions (feelings), our bodies go through many physical changes.Our hearts beat faster, and our muscles get tense.All of these changes make us more alert and ready to react.We, too.get ready to defend ourselves or run. Human beings, however, have a problem that animals never face.If we give way to our feelings and let them take over, we can get into trouble.Have you ever said something in anger --or hit somebody--and regretted it later? Have you ever shouted at a teacher, told somebody you were lonely, or said you were in love, and then wished later you had kept your mouth shut? It isn't always clever to express your feelings freely. Does this mean that it's smarter always to hide our feelings? No! If you keep feelings of anger, sadness, and bitterness hidden away or bottled up inside, your body stays tense.Physical illness can develop.It can actually be bad for your health.(It isn't good to keep pleasant feelings inside either; all feelings need to be expressed.) Feelings that you keep all bottled up inside don't just go away.It's as if you bought some bananas and stuck them in a cupboard.You might not be able to see them.but before long you' d smell them.And if you opened the cupboard, chances are that you'd see little fruit flies flying all over them.They'd be rotten.

While at college, she started an English-language tutoring program for immigrant children. No one was surprised, then, when she chose to volunteer in an orphanage in Khayelitsha, one of South Africa's poorest areas, during her junior year abroad.     At the orphanage, Johnson discovered most of the children infected with HIV at birth, many abandoned by parents too sick to care for them, or neglected by surviving  s. Few were receiving the care needed to stay healthy. Many died. When she left, all she wanted to do was go back and change what she had seen.     After graduation, Johnson began a fund-raising effort that eventually collected enough money to found UBA, a nonprofit organization intended to provide services for HIV-positive   kids aged 4 to 18 in Khayelitsha. Now UBA is housed in a church big enough for offices and the children. The staff includes counselors  , a social worker, a nurse, a cook, and a handful of volunteers, ensuring that each child has access to proper care, a free healthy meal, and emotional support. Once a week, she makes sure the children receive age-appropriate lessons about AIDS. The social worker sees to it that the kids are enrolled   in school and have safe living conditions-especially those without parents.      Johnson plans to soon relocate UBA to an even larger location with more medical staff and a field\"so the kids can run around and just feel like kids.\" She's also working with the South African Department of Health so that the new center can distribute drugs and give blood tests.      \"Many people think that HIV means death, but it doesn't,\" Johnson says. \"There's so much that can be done.\" In the five years since the center opened, not one of the 200 kids in the program has died. \"It's so emotional to see the strong, independent people they become.\" One teenage girl who had received help at UBA even announced that she wanted to become a nurse.

This species with red eyes and a thick tail is one of the largest lizards in the Caribbean. The Cuban iguana is primarily _ ; 95% of its diet consists of the leaves, flowers and fruits from as many as 30 plant species, including the seaside rock bush and various grasses. However, Cuban iguanas occasionally consume animal matter, and individuals have been observed eating the dead flesh of birds, fish and crabs, The researchers wrote that quite a few people on Isla Magueyes could have caused this incident. The Cuban iguana is distributed throughout the rocky southern coastal areas of mainland Cuba and its surrounding islands with a wild population booming on Isla Magueyes, Puerto Rico. It is also found on the Cayman Islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, where a separate subspecies occurs. Females guard their nest sites and often nest in sites half destroyed by Cuban crocodiles. To avoid the attack from them, the Cuban iguana often makes its home within or near prickly-pear cacti  . In general the species is in decline, more quickly on the mainland than on the outlying islands. One of the reasons for their decline is habitat destruction caused by the over consuming of farm animals, housing development, and the building of tourist resorts on the beaches where the animals prefer to build their nests. Although the wild population is in decline, the numbers of iguanas have been sharply increased as a result of captive-breeding  and other conservation programs. .Why does the Cuban iguana build its nest near prickly-pear cacti?\nA.To keep itself cool.\nB.To get the food easily.\nC.To stay away from people.\nD.To avoid crocodiles' attack.\nAnswer:",

Phelps's total of eight gold medals in Beijingput him one ahead of Mark Spitz's previous record set in 1972. Now people are already calling him the greatest Olympian of all time. But whether he is or not, what is it that makes Michael Phelps so good? A good place to start might be his physique . Phelps has the perfect body shape for a swimmer: his arm span is longer than his height, he has very flexible joints, huge lungs, and his incredibly large feet (size 14 in the US, size 49 inChina) act like flippers in the water. To feed his huge swimmer's body, Phelps eats an astonishing 12,000 calories a day, six times the average for a man of his age.  He then owes it to a swimsuit which has been making waves in the world of swimming. Designed by NASA, the American space agency, the suit is made of a special material which is said to help athletes swim 2% faster. Michael Phelps should spare a thought for his mum, who first pushed him into swimming as a way of making friends, and who believed in him when one teacher said he would never be a success.

        "input":"Scratchy throats, stuffy noses and body aches all spell misery, but being able to tell if the cause is a cold or flu may make a difference in how long the misery lasts. The American Lung Association (ALA) has issued new guidelines on combating colds and the flu , and one of the keys is being able to quickly tell the two apart. That's because the prescription drugs available for the flu need to be taken soon after the illness sets in. As for colds, the sooner a person starts taking over-the-counter remedy, the sooner relief will come. The common cold and the flu are both caused by viruses. More than 200 viruses can cause cold symptoms, while the flu is caused by three viruses - flu A, B and C. There is no cure for either illness , but the flu can be prevented by the flu vaccine, which is, for most people, the best way to fight the flu, according to the ALA. But if the flu does strike, quick action can help. Although the flu and common cold have many similarities , there are some obvious signs to look for. Cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose and scratchy throat typically develop gradually, and adults and teens often do not get a fever. On the other hand, fever is one of the characteristic features of the flu for all ages. And in general, flu symptoms including fever and chills, sore throat and body aches come on suddenly and are more severe than cold symptoms. The ALA notes that it may be particularly difficult to tell when infants and preschool age children have the flu. It advises parents to call the doctor if their small children have flu-like symptoms. Both cold and flu symptoms can be eased with over-the-counter medications as well. However, children and teens with a cold or flu should not take aspirin for pain relief because of the risk of Reye syndrome  ,a rare but serious condition of the liver and central nervous system. There is, of course, no vaccine for the common cold. But frequent hand washing and avoiding close contact with people who have colds can reduce the likelihood of catching one. If children have flu-like symptoms, their parents   _  .\nA.are advised not to give them aspirin\nB.should watch out for signs of Reye syndrome\nC.are encouraged to take them to hospital for vaccination\nD.should prevent them from mixing with people running a fever\nAnswer:",

He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose   tea again. Sullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze   and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. _ , and today 85% of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags. However, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea. This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy, tasty way to go.

Some things we've done are very good for the earth while some are bad. All over the world, people have cut down millions of trees. When it rains or when the wind blows, the earth is taken away. Forests have become deserts, so more and more sorts of animals and plants are disappearing. In big cities, cars and buses have polluted the air. Many people in cities now have health problems. Factories have also polluted the land and the water. As a result, many rivers and lakes are now dead. Around the earth, there's a special kind of oxygen called \"ozone\"(O3). It is important to the earth. But now air pollution is destroying it and that has made a very big hole in the ozone layer. Too much harmful radiation from the sun passes through the hole and reaches the earth directly. This is very dangerous because this kind of radiation can cause cancer. Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air has increased a lot. It mainly comes from burning oil, coal and wood. This has formed a \"blanket\" around the earth. The heat from the sun can't escape so the temperature is rising. This is called \"the greenhouse effect\". It causes the level of the oceans to rise and the climate of the earth to change.

The American idea of customer service is to make each customer the center of attention. Need proof? Just listen to the commercials. Most of them sound like the McDonald's ad: \"We do it all for you.\" Actually, not all stores in America roll out the red carpet for their customers. But wherever you go, good customer service means making customers feel special. People going shopping in America can expect to be treated with respect from the very beginning. Most places don't have a \"furniture street\" or a \"computer road\" which allow you to compare prices easily. Instead, people often \"let their fingers do the walking\" through the store hot lines. From the first \"hello\", customers receive a satisfying response to their questions. This initial contact can help them decide where to shop. When customers get to the store, they are treated as honored guests. Customers don't usually find store clerks sitting around watching TV or playing cards. Instead, the clerks greet them warmly and offer to help them find what they want. In most stores, the clear signs that label each department make shopping a breeze. Customers usually don't have to ask how much items cost, since prices are clearly marked. And unless they're at a flea market or a yard sale, they don't bother trying to bargain. When customers are ready to check out, they find the nearest and shortest checkout lane. But as Murphy's Law would have it, whichever lane they get in, all the other lanes will move faster. Good stores open new checkout lanes when the lanes get too long. Some even offer express lanes for customers with 10 items or less. After they pay for their purchases, customers receive a smile and a warm \"thank you\" from the clerk. Many stores even allow customers to take their shopping carts out to the parking lot. That way, they don't have to carry heavy bags out to the car. Which of the following can be the best title of this passage?\nA.Customer Service in America\nB.Excellent Stores in America\nC.Shopping Rules in America\nD.Being King or Queen in America\nAnswer:",

But Heather Ramirez and her husband, from California, in the United States, make a living in an unusual way. They are self-employed   snake catchers! They catch snakes, especially rattlesnakes which have gone indoors, and return them to the wild. Heather describes her work as \"protecting people from rattlesnakes -- and protecting rattlesnakes from people!\" In the area where they live, rattlesnakes often come face to face with people. They are found in stores, offices, houses and gardens. Heather explains that it's not the snakes that are moving into places where people live, but it's the other way round. The snakes lived in these places first and then the people built houses. Most people who see a rattlesnake are feared. If you keep your distance, however, the snake won't bite   you. In twelve years as a snake catcher, Heather has never touched a snake. She doesn't take the risk. She picks up the snakes with a special tool.

And over here, a class of students watching it all. A field trip to a nature center? No, it's a schoolyard. With some work on your part, it could even be your schoolyard. Interested in building a schoolyard habitat? Here's how to get started. Gather a Team Students can do a lot on their own, but you'll need adults for a project this big. Get teachers, parents,  and  even  the  headmaster  interested.  Don't  forget  the  maintenance staff--they know more about your school's yard than anyone else and can give you lots of help. Also, ask around your neighborhood for gardeners, naturalists, and others willing to give advice. Map Your Site Which part of the schoolyard can you turn  into a habitat? Is there an unused corner of the playground? Part of a lawn or field you could let go wild? You'll need to make a map of the area showing what's  there now. Then  you  can  figure out  how you want  to  change  it. For  that, you need a plan. Plan a Habitat Here's what you'll need to make your area attractive to wildlife. Food: Plant  flowers, bushes,  and  trees. These  provide  seeds, berries,  leaves,  flowers,  and sweet  liquids.  And  all  of  these  feed  birds,  and  insects.  You  can  also  add  some  feeders  for squirrels and birds. Where possible, stick with native plants--wild plants that grow naturally in your area. They need less care, which means less work for you. Water: A  small pond, birdbath, or  even  a  shallow dish  of  clean water  in  the ground will attract birds. Other small animals like insects may visit as well. Shelter: Bushes and trees make great escapes for birds. Tall grass and \"weeds\" are home to grasshoppers, garter  snakes,  and  some  ground-nesting birds. You  can  also  add  stone  piles  and brush piles. Places to Raise Young: Butterflies need special plants to lay their eggs on. Frogs and toads lay eggs only  in shallow water. Many birds use birdhouses; others nest  in  trees and bushes.  In fact, nearly all your shelters may become homes for wild young. Put It on Paper Using the map you made of your area, draw in the changes you want to make. Mark where the plants, nest boxes, and other items will go. Remember, this is a long-term plan--you don't have  to  do  everything  this  spring. Maybe  you  could  put  up  a  few  birdhouses  and  plant  some butterfly bushes now and save the trees and bushes for next year. Even a small start is a big step for wildlife. Reach for Resources To make the habitat happen, you'll need lots of plants, seeds, and other supplies. You'll also need to buy or borrow tools and maybe even some heavy equipment. Now's the time to reach out for donations. Start by asking your parent-teacher organization. Then go to garden clubs, garden stores (they might give you a discount), local government agencies, and businesses. If they can't donate supplies or money, ask if they can donate workers! The workers can help build  the habitat. You'll also need people  to help maintain  it. Some schools ask their students' families to take turns during the summer. Each family maintains  the habitat for a couple of weeks. Build Your Design Now you can dig in. Set a date, and get growing! The main purpose for creating a nature habitat at school would be to  _  .\nA.improve the school's appearance\nB.raise money for other school projects\nC.teach students more about nature\nD.convince people to work as volunteers\nAnswer:",

They raised chickens for eggs , pigs and cattle for meat . Cows were kept for milk and the cream, from which Grandma made butter and cheese. What little yard they had became a garden. The Depression, therefore, didn't make much change in their lives. But it did bring an unending flow of men out of work, drifting from job to job, to the farm. The first to show up at the door of the kitchen was a man in rags. He took off his hat and quietly explained that he hadn't eaten for a while. Grandpa stood watching him a bit , then said , \"There's a stack of firewood against the fence behind the barn  . I've been needing to get it moved to the other side of the fence . You have just about enough time to finish the job before lunch .\" Grandma said a surprising thing happened. The man got a shine in his eyes and he hurried to the barn at once. She set another place at the table and made an apple pie. During lunch, the stranger didn't say much, but when he left, his shoulders had straightened. \"Nothing ruins a man like losing his self-respect,\" Grandpa later told me. Soon after, another man showed up asking for a meal. This one was dressed in a suit and carried a small old suitcase. Grandpa came out when he heard voices.

Fred, a lively young man, knew little German when he arrived, but after two months' study, the language began to come to him. School was completely different from what he had expected-much harder. Students rose respectfully when the teacher entered the room. They took fourteen subjects instead of the six that are usual in the United States. There were almost no outside activities. Family life, too, was different. The father's word was law, and all activities were around the family rather than the individual . Fred found the food too simple at first. Also, he missed having a car. \"Back home, you pick up some friends in a car and go out and have a good time.

A family environment plays an important role for children in learning to communicate with others and understanding table manners, such as waiting for others to finish before leaving the table and not speaking with a mouth full of food.

        "input":"He came into the room to shut the windows while we were still in bed and I saw he looked ill. He was shivering, his face was white, and he walked slowly as though it ached to move. \"What's the matter, Schatz?\" \"I've got a headache.\" \"You better go back to bed.\" \"No. I'm all right.\" \"You go to bed. I'll see you when I'm dressed.\" But when I came downstairs he was dressed, sitting by the fire, looking a very sick and miserable boy of nine years. When I put my hand on his forehead I knew he had a fever. \"You go up to bed,\" I said, \"You're sick.\" \"I'm all right,\" he said. When the doctor came he took the boy's temperature. \"What's is it?\" I asked him. \"One hundred and two.\" Downstairs, the doctor left three different medicines in different colored capsules with instructions for giving them. One was to bring down the fever, another a purgative , the third to overcome an acid condition. The germs of influenza can only exist in an acid condition, he explained. He seemed to know all about influenza and said there was nothing to worry about if the fever did not go above one hundred and four degrees. This was a light epidemic(;) of flu and there was no danger if you avoided pneumonia . Back in the room I wrote the boy's temperature down and made a note of the time to give the various capsules. \"Do you want me to read to you?\" \"All right. If you want to, \" said the boy. His face was very white and there were dark areas under his eyes. He lay still in the bed and seemed very detached(;)from what was going on. I read aloud from Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates ;but I could see he was not following what I was reading. \"How do you feel, Schatz?\" I asked him. \"Just the same, so far,\" he said. I sat at the foot of the bed and read to myself while I waited for it to be time to give another capsule. It would have been natural for him to go to sleep, but when I looked up he was looking at the foot of the bed, looking very strangely. \"Why don't you try to sleep? I'll wake you up for the medicine.\" \"I'd rather stay awake.\" After a while he said to me, \"You don't have to stay in here with me, Papa, if it bothers you.\" \"It doesn't bother me.\" \"No, I mean you don't have to stay if it's going to bother you.\" I thought perhaps he was a little lightheaded and after giving him the prescribed capsules at eleven o'clock I went out with my gun and the young hunting dog....I killed two quail , and missed five, and started back pleased to have found a covey of quail close to the house and happy there were so many left to find on another day. At the house they said the boy had refused to let anyone come into the room. \"You can't come in,\" he said. \"You mustn't get what I have.\" I went up to him and found him in exactly the position I had left him, white-faced, but with the tops of his cheeks flushed by the fever, staring still, as he had stared, at the foot of the bed. I took his temperature. \"What is it?\" \"Something like a hundred,\" I said. It was one hundred and two and four tenths. \"It was a hundred and two,\" he said. \"Who said so?\" \"The doctor.\" \"Your temperature is all right,\" I said. \"It's nothing to worry about.\" \"I don't worry,\" he said, \"but I can't keep from thinking.\" \"Don't think,\" I said. \"Just take it easy.\" \"I'm taking it easy,\" he said and looked straight ahead, He was evidently holding tight onto himself about something. \"Take this with water.\" \"Do you think it will do any good?\" \"Of course it will.\" I sat down and opened the Pirate book and began to read, but I could see he was not following, so I stopped. \"About what time do you think I'm going to die?\" he asked. \"What?\" \"About how long will it be before I die?\" \"You aren't going to die. What's the matter with you? \" \"Oh, yes, I am, I heard him say a hundred and two.\" \"People don't die with a fever of one hundred and two. That's a silly way to talk.\" \"I know they do. At school in France the boys told me you can't live with forty-four degrees. I've got a hundred and two.\" He had been waiting to die all day, ever since nine o'clock in the morning. \"You poor Schatz,\" I said. \"Poor old Schatz. It's like miles and kilometers. You aren't going to die. That's different thermometer. On that thermometer thirty-seven is normal. On this kind it's ninety-eight.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Absolutely,\" I said, \"It's like miles and kilometers. You know, like how many kilometers we make when we do seventy miles in the car?\" \"Oh,\" he said. But his gaze at the foot of the bed relaxed slowly. The hold over himself relaxed too, finally, and the next day it was very slack  and he cried very easily at little things that were of no importance.

        "input":"Cherie Blair has attacked \"yummy mummies\" who focus on raising their children at the expense of their careers, suggesting their children lack a sense of independence. The wife of the then British Prime Minister also accused some young women of seeking to \"marry a rich husband and retire\" instead of working. Mrs Blair, a QC and mother of four, criticized women who \"put all their effort into their children\" instead of working. Mothers who go out to work are setting a better example for their children, she said. Some women regard motherhood as an acceptable alternative to a career. Instead, women should strive for both. \"Every woman needs to be self-sufficient and in that way you really don't have a choice-for your own satisfaction; you hear these yummy mummies talk about being the best possible mother and they put all their effort into their children. I also want to be the best possible mother, but I know that my job as a mother includes bringing my children up so actually they can live without me.\" The term \"yummy mummy\" is generally used to refer to a woman whose husband's wealth allows her to devote herself full-time to her children and her appearance. In fact, despite Mrs Blair's worries about non-working mothers, official statistics show that the proportion of mothers who work has actually risen steadily in recent years. According to the Office for National Statistics, 66 percent of mothers are now in some form of paid work. In 1996, the figure was 61 percent. The number of working mothers is now around 5.3 million, up from 4.5 million in 1996. Speaking to Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women event in Claridge's, Mrs Blair appeared to accuse some young women of lacking professional ambition, focusing on their prospective partner's career instead of their own. Mrs Blair said her view was informed by her own experience of her father abandoning her mother when she was a child. But she insisted that all women should make sure they can provide for themselves: \"Even good men could have an accident or die and you're left holding the baby.\" Often in the headlines during her husband's premiership, Mrs Blair has taken a more active public role since he left office in 2007, setting up a charitable foundation to support women setting up their own firms in developing countries. We know from the passage that   _  .\nA.The number of working mothers has dropped since 1996.\nB.Mrs. Blair worked even when her husband was Prime Minister\nC.Most women in Britain would like to be yummy mommies.\nD.Mrs. Blair was worried about those working mothers.\nAnswer:",

I worked there for seven years and learned so many lessons, especially from a fellow waitress Helen who had incredible self-respect and did what she loved--serving people. She made everyone smile and feel good, customers and co-workers alike. Being a waitress changed my life. One of my regular customers was Fred Hasbrook, an electronics salesman. Thanks to the newfound confidence I picked up from Helen, I dreamed of having my own restaurant. But when I called my parents to ask for a loan, they said, \"We just don't have the money.\" The next day, I shared my dream with him and said, \"Fred, I know I can do more if somebody would just have faith in me.\" He walked over to some of the other diner regulars and the next day handed me checks totaling $50,000--along with a note that I have to this day. It reads, \"The only collateral on this loan is my trust in your honesty as a person. Good people with a dream should have the opportunity to make that dream come true.\" I took the checks to Merrill Lynch--the first time I had ever entered a brokerage house--where the money was invested for me. I continued working at the Buttercup, making plans for the restaurant I would open. My investments soured, though, and I lost the money. After great deliberation  I decided to apply for a job at Merrill Lynch. Even though I had no experience, I was hired and ended up becoming a pretty good broker. Eventually I paid back Fred and my customers the $50,000, plus 14-percent annual interest. Five years later, I was able to open my own firm. I got a thank-you note from Fred, which will be imprinted on my head forever. He had been sick and wrote that my check had helped cover his mounting medical bills.

Researches from Yale and Stanford predict that by 2030 urban areas will expand by 590,000 square miles--nearly the size of Mongolia--to meet the needs of 1.47 billion more people living in urban areas. \"It is likely that these cities are going to be developed in places that are the most biologically diverse,\" said Karen Seto, a famous scientist at Yale University. \"They are going to be growing and expanding into forests, biological hotspots, savannas , coastlines--sensitive and _ places.\" Urban areas, they found, have been expanding more rapidly along coasts. \"Of all the places for cities to grow, coasts are the most sensitive. People and buildings along the coast are at risk of flooding and other environmental disasters,\" said Seto. The study provides the first estimate of how fast urban areas globally are growing and how fast they may grow in the future. \"We know a lot about global patterns of urban population growth, but we know significantly less about how urban areas are changing,\" she said. \"Changes in land cover associated with urbanization lead to many environmental changes, from habitats loss and agricultural land conversion  to changes in local and regional climate.\" The researchers examined studies that used satellite data to map urban growth and found that from 1970 to 2000 the world's urban footprint had grown by at least 22,400 square miles--half the size of Ohio. \"This number is numerous, but, in actuality, urban land expansion has been far greater than what our analysis shows because we only looked at the published studies that used satellite data,\" said Seto. \"We found that 48 of the most populated urban areas have been studied using satellite data, with findings in journals. This means that we're not tracking the physical expansion of more than half of the world's largest cities.\" Half of urban land expansion in China is driven by a rising middle class, whereas the size of cities in India and Africa is driven primarily by population growth. \"Rising incomes translate into rising demand for bigger homes and more land for urban development, which has a great effect on biodiversity conservations, loss of carbon sinks and energy use.\" Cities in Africa become bigger and bigger mainly because of their   _  .\nA.growing population\nB.rising middle class\nC.unique living patterns\nD.economic development\nAnswer:",

About 70% of the Earth is covered with water. Why do we have day and night? When the half of the Earth is facing the Sun, it's daytime. As the Earth turns and this half is away from the Sun, night is coming. And it's daytime for the other half.

        "input":"Warning: reading too much Cinderella  to your daughter may damage her emotional health in later life. A paper to be developed at the international congress of cognitive psychotherapy  in Gothenburg suggests a link between the attitudes of women abused  by their parents and early exposure to the wrong sort of fairy tales. It says girls who identified with Cinderella, Rapunzel  and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast were more likely to stay in destructive relationships as adults. The theory was developed by Susan Darker Smith, a psychotherapist at the University of Derby. She interviewed 67 female abuse survivors and found that 61 put up with severe abuse because they believed they could change their partners with patience, composition and love. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. Hardly any of the women in a control group, who had not experienced abuse, thought they could change their partners in this way.     The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. These women and men said they would leave a relationship rather than put up with abuse from a partner. Ms Darker Smith found the abused women were much more likely to identify with Cinderella and other _ female characters in fairytales, who were later rescued by a stranger prince or hero. Although most girls heard the stories, damage appeared to be done to those who adopted the characters as role models. \"They believe if their love is strong enough they can change their parents' behaviors,\" she said.\" Overexposure in children to stories that emphasize the transformational qualities of love may make women believe they can change their partners.\" For example, they might never have understood the obvious flaw in the story of Rapunzel, who remained locked in a high tower until rescued by a knight on a white horse, who broke the door down. \"The question,\" said Ms Darker Smith, \"is why she did not break the door down herself.\" Which of the following statements is true of the women in a control group?\nA.They don't believe in fairy tales.\nB.They don't believe in the transformational qualities of love.\nC.They have also experienced abuse.\nD.They survived abuse.\nAnswer:",

It is widely liked by the young people. The best known early form of pop music was \"rock-n-roll\"; another was \"blues\". A more recent development is \"folk-rock\". Pop music has taken the place of native music in many parts of the world; it has caused the number of people for jazz to become much smaller than it was in the 1950s and earlier, and it has now begun to rule musical stage productions.

        "input":"A wise man once said that the only thing necessary for the victory of evil is for good men to do nothing. So, as a police officer, I have some urgent things to say to good people. Day after day my men and I struggle to hold back a tidal wave of crime. Something has gone terribly wrong with our once-proud American way of life. It has happened in the area of values. A key ingredient is disappearing, and I think I know what it is: accountability. Accountability isn't hard to define. It means that every person is responsible for his or her actions and liable for their consequences. Of the many values that hold civilization together --- honesty, kindness, and so on --- accountability may be the most important of all. Without it, there can be no respect, no trust, no law --- and, ultimately, no society. My job as a police officer is to impose accountability on people who refuse, or have never learned, to impose it on themselves. But as every policeman knows, external controls on people's behavior are far less effective than internal restraints such as guilt, shame and embarrassment. Fortunately there are still communities --- smaller towns, usually --- where schools maintain discipline and where parents hold up standards that declare: \"In this family certain things are not tolerated --- they simply are not done!\" Yet more and more, especially in our larger cities and suburbs, these inner restraints are loosening. Your typical robber has none. He considers your property his property; he takes what he wants, including your life if you annoy him. The main cause of this breakdown is a radical shift in attitudes. Thirty years ago, if a crime was committed, society was considered the victim. Now, in a shocking reversal, it's the criminal who is considered victimized: by his underprivileged   upbringing, by the school that didn't teach him to read, by the church that failed to reach him with moral guidance, by the parents who didn't provide a stable home. I don't believe it. Many others in equally disadvantaged circumstances choose not to engage in criminal activities. If we free the criminal, even partly, from accountability, we become a society of endless excuses where no one accepts responsibility for anything. We in America desperately need more people who believe that the person who commits a crime is the one responsible for it.. Compared with those in small towns, people in large cities have   _  .\nA.less self-discipline\nB.better sense of discipline\nC.more respect to each other\nD.less effective government\nAnswer:",

Thousands and thousands of children have read this story, only to ask for it again and again. It has travelled the wide world over, and has been told in every country. Hans Christian Andersen, the author of \"The Ugly Duckling,\" was born in Denmark. If you look on a map, you will see this little country in northern Europe. There, in the little village of Odense, he spent his boyhood. His father and mother were very poor. The family lived in two little rooms near the top of a house, where his father worked as a shoemaker. On the roof was a box filled with earth. In this box his mother planted her vegetables. Little Hans loved to walk with his father in the woods, where he could pick wild flowers and hear the birds sing. His father read to him when his work was done, or told him stories. What his father did helped him open up a new world. Once, when Hans was still a child, he went into a wheat field with his mother and a number of children, to pick the rest wheat which the reapers  had left in the field. While they were busy picking only a small amount of wheat for each of them, an angry bailiff  came rushing into the field, armed with a whip . All ran, as fast as they could, away from the angry man. _ and the sharp stalks  of the wheat plants which had been cut down, cut his feet so that he could not get away. Unafraid, the boy faced the angry man and his upraised whip. \"How dare you hit me when you know God sees you?\" he cried, looking fearlessly into the face of the angry bailiff. The whip came down, but not on little Hans. The bailiff admired the boy's courage, and praised him for it. He sent him home with gifts, rather than punishments.[:] While Hans was still a boy, his kind father died. Then Hans and his mother were left alone, to care for each other. \"What will you do, Hans?\" the mother asked \"Would you like to become a tailor?\" \"No, mother,\" the boy answered; \"I will go to Copenhagen and study. One day I shall write books.\" \"But where will the money be found to pay your way?\" asked the mother. \"I will work, and God will take care of me,\" Hans replied.

I was working too many hours and became very sick. I was working a double shift at the Southwest Airlines ticket counter, it was about 9:00 PM on Christmas Eve, and I was feeling really miserable inside. There were a few of us working and very few customers waiting to be helped. When it was time for me to call the next person to the counter, I looked out to see the sweetest-looking old man standing with a cane. He walked very slowly over to the counter and in the faintest voice told me that he had to go to New Orleans. I tried to explain to him that there were no more flights that night and that he would have to go in the morning. He looked so confused and very worried. I tried to find out more information by asking if he had a reservation or if he remembered when he was supposed to travel, but he seemed to become more confused with each question. He just kept saying, \"She said I have to go to New Orleans.\" After much time, I was able to at least find out that this old man had been dropped off at the curb on Christmas Eve by his sister-in-law and told to go to New Orleans, where he had family. She had given him some cash and told him just to go inside and buy a ticket. When I asked if he could come back tomorrow, he said that she was gone and that he had no place to stay. He then said he would wait at the airport until tomorrow. Naturally, I felt a little ashamed. Here I was feeling very sorry for myself about being alone on Christmas, when this angel named Clarence MacDonald was sent to me to remind me of what being alone really meant. It broke my heart. Immediately, I told him we would get it all straightened out, and our Customer Service agent helped to book him a seat for the earliest flight the next morning. We gave him the senior citizen's fare, which gave him some extra money for travelling. About this time he started to look very tired, and when I stepped around the counter to ask him if he was all right, I saw that his leg was wrapped in a bandage. He had been standing on it that whole time, holding a plastic bag full of clothes. I called for a wheelchair. When the wheelchair came, we all stepped around to help him in, and I noticed a small amount of blood on his bandage. I asked how he hurt his leg, and he said that he had just had bypass surgery and an artery was taken from his leg. Can you imagine? This man had had heart surgery, and then shortly afterward, was dropped off at the curb to buy a ticket with no reservation to fly to New Orleans, alone! I never really had a situation like this, and I wasn't sure what I could do. I went back to ask my supervisors if we could find a place for him to stay. They both said yes, and they obtained a hotel voucher for Mr. MacDonald for one night and a meal ticket for dinner and breakfast. When I came back out, we got his plastic bag of clothes and cane together and gave the porter a tip to take him downstairs to wait for the airport shuttle. I bent down to explain the hotel, food and itinerary   again to Mr. MacDonald, and then patted him on the arm and told him everything would be just fine.

        "input":"Some time ago I received a gift from both of my children. It had nothing to do with Father's Day. Yet, at the same time it had everything to do with Father's Day. My son was studying in a high school in Colorado. He lived in the school. While we were talking on the phone he shared some wonderful news with me. He said, \"You know Dad, I am really happy with my life. I can't think of a thing that I would change about the way that I grew up, or the way that my life is now. \" My daughter was living with her mother in Northern California at that time. She said almost the same thing to me just a few days later. Of course, I was delighted to hear this from both of them. And I told them both  how happy I was, not only that they were happy ,but that they expressed it to me. And that was the gift that they were giving me ---with the heart to communicate. Certainly I hope for good news when I hear from them. But mostly I love that they will share their real feelings with me. Happy or sad, I love to be touched by their real thoughts and feelings. For a child, Father's Day isn't really about giving Dad a gift. It is about understanding the love that fathers express when they help put food on the table, teach their child to ride a bike, cheer at a soccer game, etc. For a father, Father's Day isn't so much about receiving gifts for a job well done. Remember, the greatest gift that we give our children is the real expression of our love. It isn't enough for them to feel love inside ourselves: we need to express that love.

        "input":"You may never think a documentary film could have aroused so much public enthusiasm in Chinese history. Nowadays everybody is talking about a new 7-part documentary called A Bite of China which was recently broadcast late at night on CCTV I. The documentary describes various _ across the vast Chinese culinary landscape. According to Taobao, China's biggest online retail website, just five days after the series began to air, nearly 6 million people went to the site in search of various local specialties, particularly those mentioned in the documentary. More than 7.2 million deals were concluded. A ham producer from Yunnan Province saw his sales grow 17-fold in five days. However, one can't help but believe that the documentary's popularity is probably linked to the endless stream of terrible food security issues that have emerged in recent years. In one well-received article, a netizen wrote, \"I wonder how many felt so empty-hearted and sighed after watching the film. Blue-vitriol watered chive, formaldehyde sprayed cabbage, Sudan Red colored salty eggs, restaurants using gutter oil. The list is long...\" How will a varied and ancient food culture that is famous worldwide and which should have made the Chinese proud end? Food is the most vital thing in people's lives. Yet China's food industry has made people a little worried due to some severe food safety crisis. The market is huge while the cost of faking and cheating is so low for immoral businessmen; and the punishment is too light. Take the milk industry as an example. Although Sanlu, the company that sold the melamine-adulterated milk powder, was punished, thousands of other dairies didn't work hard to improve the quality. Therefore, food safety problems should be an important concern of Chinese government so that our ancient food culture can be preserved. As the documentary shows, people are attracted not to gourmet items like matsutake, a species of rare mushroom grown naturally in remote forests, but to common Chinese dishes like barley, lotus root or tofu. They are what meet our basic needs. This explains why people are so excited about A Bite of China---it is a reminder that there is still a world out there where food is excellent and safe. According to the passage, China's food industry has a problem of faking and cheating because  _  .\nA.there are still so many poor people at the present time\nB.the punishment for unscrupulous businessmen isn't serious enough\nC.the Chinese government encourages it to do so\nD.the food technology is not so advanced as in developing countries\nAnswer:",

He looked to be in his late 40s but was probably a lot younger. He had shoulder length straight black hair and a short beard. Every day after work I would remember to gather any spare change, and put it aside to give to him if I saw him. A feeling of joy would come over me every time I saw him, while coming off the ramp  . So did he. Sometimes the red light would be on for a minute and we would ask each other about our day. His answer would always be the same, \"I'm blessed!\" Then one day I was called into my boss's office and was told that I was being laid off. For the rest of that day all I could think of was \"how am I going to provide for my kids as a mother, how am I going to pay rent?\" Needless to say that on my way home that day I was very sad and upset. I didn't remember to look for my spare change and keep it ready like I usually did. Yet there he was as always, as I turned the ramp. He set his eyes on me, while still smiling and waving at others as usual. While I was waiting for the red light to turn, he strolled   over to my car. He had a big smile. He looked at me straight in the eyes and said, \"Today I will give you a dollar.\" He then reached into his pocket and pulled out a dollar bill.

        "input":"According to its label  , a pint of Haagen-Dazs ice cream contains four servings  . But when was the last time you measured out a fourth of a container of Cookies & Cream, then put the rest away for another day? For many people, the reality is that much of a pint can easily disappear in one sitting. A large package of Cool Ranch Doritos lists a single serving as roughly 12 chips, but it's hard to imagine keeping count of every last chip as you dig into a bag. Canned soup may be one of the more obvious examples. According to its label, a single serving of Campbell's Chunky Classic Chicken Noodle soup is one cup--just under half a can-- and contains about 790 milligrams of sodium  . But in a national survey of 1,000 consumers, only 10 percent of people said they would eat a one-cup portion. Most, about 64 percent, said they would eat an entire can at one time, taking in 1,840 milligrams of sodium in a sitting. That is roughly 80 percent of the 2,300 milligrams recommended as the upper limit for daily salt intake. In the face of increasing criticism, the Food and Drug Administration (F.D.A.) has been under pressure for years to force food makers to include more realistic serving-size information on their labels. The agency regulates the serving sizes that can be listed on packages by providing food makers with detailed instructions to follow, which list the amounts of a specific food that a person would \"customarily consume\" in a typical sitting. But critics say these so-called reference amounts are often laughably small because they're based in part on surveys of eating behavior that were carried out in the 1970s, when Americans ate less food and portions had not been supersized. Now, in an effort to emphasize the problems with some labels, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group, has picked out what it says are some of the worst offenders. At the top of its list are labels for canned soups, ice cream, coffee creamers and nonstick cooking sprays--all of which grossly understate   the calories, sodium and saturated fat the average person typically consumes when eating these foods. The F.D.A. has been in the process of revising existing food labels since 2005. But the agency has been somewhat tight-lipped about where it is in the process and any changes it plans to make, like whether labels should include details on added sugars or just total sugar, for example, and whether calories should be emphasized less or more than they are now. This fall, the Institute of Medicine is expected to release its own report on food packaging and labeling as well. According to the passage, when eating canned soup,   _  .\nA.people are aware of the amount they take in\nB.people are worried about the amount they take in\nC.many people take in too big an amount unconsciously\nD.most people follow the instructions on the label closely\nAnswer:",

These satellite-based systems provide turn-by-turn directions to help people get to where they want to go. But, they can also cause a lot of problems, send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost. Many times, the driver is to blame. Sometimes a GPS error is responsible. Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two. We spoke to Mr. Brown by Skype. He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. Barry Brown: \"And they just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in. So again, the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\" Mister Brown says this is a common human error. But, he says, what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings, or failures, of GPS equipment. Barry Brown: \"One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn. Because they just give you the next turn, sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the overview that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place.\" Barry Brown formerly served as a professor with the University of California, San Diego. While there, he worked on a project with Eric Laurier from the University of Edinburgh. The two men studied the effects of GPS devices on driving by placing cameras in people's cars. They wrote a paper based on their research. It is called \"The Normal, Natural Troubles of Driving with GPS.\" It lists several areas where GPS systems can cause confusion for drivers. These include maps that are outdated, incorrect or difficult to understand. They also include timing issues related to when GPS commands are given. Barry Brown says to make GPS systems better we need a better understanding of how drivers, passengers and GPS systems work together.

Better for the environment Sustainability   and global warming are such hot topics at the moment, and many people want to do their bit to help support a healthier environment. Small action carried out by many people can make a big difference. Most materials in an average North American meal have traveled about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate. To cut out a big part of this travel would greatly reduce not only pollution from transportation and refrigeration but also customers' expenses as well. Taste and nutritional content Locally-grown fruits and vegetables are usually sold within 24 hours of being harvested. Because they are picked at the height of ripeness   and travel only a short distance to the market, their freshness, nutrition, and flavor are kept.

It is a call for every American to pay attention to the destruction we risk by allowing human-induced  climate change to continue. It is impossible to prove that Hurricane Katrina was caused by global warming, or even that human activities made the storm more severe. However, a paper published in the scholarly journal Nature reports that the force of dangerous hurricanes has increased by 50% during the last 50 years. It also reports that a global warming-induced rise in temperature near the ocean's surface has probably contributed to this increase in dangerous storms, and thus to property  damage and human death. On August 30, the Los Angeles Times summed up  the view of many scientists who agree that if the frequency of hurricanes does not decrease in the next few years, then we will be fairly certain that humans, and not natural storm cycle, are at the root of the problem. I believe there is at least a chance that by reducing U.S. reliance on fossil fuels for energy, we can prevent future tragedies like Hurricane Katrina. Let the change begin now. There are many ways to reduce the volume of greenhouse gas emissions. My family drives the most fuel-efficient car we can afford, but I prefer to take public transportation whenever possible. My family buys locally grown food instead of produce that was transported thousands of miles on fuel-burning vehicles. We also replaced our incandescent light bulbs with more energy-efficient compact fluorescents . This might sound like a trivial move, but the Union of Concerned Scientists reports that if every household in the United States replaced one incandescent bulb with a compact fluorescent, it would have the same effect on U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions as removing 7.5 million cars from the roads. Now think if every household replaced not just one but all of their incandescent bulbs! The United States, with just five percent of the world's population, is responsible for close to one quarter of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, yet our country is doing far less than most European nations to fight global warming. We don't have to sacrifice our lifestyles; Europeans enjoy the same standards of living as Americans. So what are we waiting for? It is time to act.

Men rule the world, but their mothers and wives rule them. Most American women wish to make their husbands and sons successful, but some of them want more for themselves. They want good jobs. When they work they want to be better paid. They want to be as successful as men. The American women's liberation movement was started by women who didn't want to stand behind successful men. They wanted to stand beside men, with the same chance for success. They refused to work side by side with men who do the same work for a higher pay. A liberated woman must be proud of being a woman and have confidence in herself. If somebody says to her, \"You have come a long way, baby.\" she will smile and answer, \"Not nearly as far as I'm going to go, baby!\" This movement is quite new, and many American women don't agree yet.

        "input":"Today's modern life discourages people from taking time to prepare their own meals. Eating in the car and grabbing a quick bite in a restaurant are ever more popular ways of dining. It takes a little extra effort and time to cook your own food, but it's a worthwhile pursuit that can benefit your health, wallet and family. People across the country are waking up to the fact that the food offered by most fast food restaurants isn't particularly healthy. While these restaurants have made attempts lately to add healthier meals to their menus, it's still _ a dish cooked with fresh ingredients  and personal care. Nutritionists who study what is called \"the French paradox\"--- meaning the fact that French people have low obesity rates despite their diet containing lots of \"unhealthy\" ingredients such as butter---partially account for this circumstance by the fact that many French people use fresh ingredients. Taking time to eat at a leisurely pace also helps you get better nutrition and you are less likely to pack on the pounds. Even a quick meal will usually cost at least five dollars per person at a restaurant. Compare this to the amount of pasta, vegetables or meat available for the same money at your home, and it quickly becomes apparent that the cost of eating out adds up. Experimenting with new ingredients or foreign recipes will encourage children to try new foods and learn about dishes from around the world. Many couples also find that preparing a meal together can be a romantic experience equal to dinner in a classy, low-lit restaurant. Make sure to spend meal times talking and sharing events from the day and you may find it's a great way to get to know your family better. Why is \"the French paradox\" referred to in the passage?\nA.To show the French diet is fairly delicious.\nB.To illustrate the French have a healthy diet.\nC.To stress the importance of using fresh food ingredients.\nD.To prove the French diet makes people fat easily.\nAnswer:",

Unfortunately, as my typing speed increased on the Internet, all grammatical rules _ You see instant messages have their own shorthand language and grammar isn't important, of which even a newbie   is aware. They can leave out articles, subjects  , pronouns, etc. They can misspell or \"respell\" almost any word. They often ask \"A\/S\/L\" when they first chat. Abbreviations   and capitalizations   are particularly important. English-speaking instant messengers also refuse to burden themselves with punctuation and capitalization. After I came back China, I discovered not one but two instant messaging crazes. The first, which brought back memories of my previous addiction to the computer, was QQ. I can see evidence that the Chinese have the same kind of separate instant messaging language, even when they chat in English. My first word in this language, for example, was \"ft\". This abbreviation for \"faint\" is used whenever there is a need to express surprise. I also discovered that Chinese use the same kind of abbreviation for a laugh. And there is an extraordinary number of smileys   to the \"vomit\" and \"army soldier\" smileys. There is even a SARA smiley. After QQ, there is another, perhaps more widespread messaging trend. You guessed it --- cell phone text messaging. I now understand how useful text messaging is and why it is so common. I admit that I have been guilty of sending text messages while walking outside or sitting on the subway. Who hasn't ? No matter where I go, I see people on their cell phones, messaging. In fact, it's rare to see someone actually talking on their phone! So it looks as if there is no escape from the instant messaging crazes, no matter where in the world I go.

Golden focuses on the study of transportation.  He spends his days studying the relationships between cars, subways, and trains. But he's most excited about imagining the way these relationships will change in the future. Many public transportation supporters dislike big cities because they spend hours driving from one side of the city to the other.  And there aren't enough buses and. subways. However, Golden sees a trend   toward fewer cars' in the future. He explains, \"Cities have a cost of car ownership, which is a challenge. All these vehicles cost the city in services, in having to repair roads and other things. \"Cars also take up a lot of space. Golden points out that having so many parking spaces is wasteful. Much of the time the parking spaces sit empty. What is the solution?\"I think cities will make new laws to limit the number of cars people can have ,\" says Golden. \"Instead, people will use taxis, subways, and buses. New technology, like smartphones, can make these forms of public transportation even better. Imagine if everyone had a smartphone and used them to signal  when they wanted to ride the bus. Buses could change their route  to meet people's requests.\" How soon would these changes come? Golden admits that it will take several years.  Cities can be slow to change. Also, new systems of transportation can be expensive. \"But it's coming,\" he says. \"The trend of the empowered city will be here soon. \" The other trend that excites Golden is electric cars. Golden especially believes in the future of electric cars that have sensors  to understand the world around them. \"If we have cars that can communicate with one another, they can adjust speeds to cut down on traffic jams,\"he says. Rush hour in big cities would be much less painful. One challenge is that it is hard to cheaply produce batteries that are strong enough for these cars. But Golden argues we could, also make cars out of strong plastic composites . The cars would then be much lighter and much cheaper to make. Golden remains positive about the future. \"There are so many exciting developments ,\"he says. \"In thirty years we will live a different world. \" Which of the following statements is true according to Golden?\nA.New buses will take the place of cars as a way of transportation.\nB.Electric cars with sensors will be able to put an end to traffic jams.\nC.Future cars could be lighter because of strong and powerful batteries.\nD.Future buses can receive signals and change their routes accordingly:\nAnswer:",

His buildings were not only beautiful, but they were also practical and useful. They fit their purposes very well. Wright's churches, for example, make people feel like thinking and praying. His office buildings make people enjoy working, and his houses make people feel comfortable at home. However, Frank Lloyd Wright's beautiful, practical and useful buildings are not the only reason that he is famous. There is another reason. Frank Lloyd Wright is called the greatest American architect because he started an American style in architecture. Most of the architecture in the United States before Wright was really European, not American. Wright's buildings do not look like old European buildings. They have their own style. Wright's ideas about style are still used in the United States and in other parts of the world. The most important idea in Frank Lloyd Wright's Style of Architecture is that a building must fit its purpose and the land around it. His houses are often called \"grass-land houses\" because their lines are similar to the lines on the grassland. Both the lines of the grassland and the lines of Wright's house are parallel to the horizon, the place where earth and sky seem to meet. They are horizontal lines. Most European style houses, in contrast, have many vertical lines that form 90degangles with the horizon.

They carried out the first two experiments from the sidewalk near Berkeley. They noted that drivers of newer and more expensive cars were more likely to cut in on other cars and pedestrians at crosswalks. Nearly 45 percent of people driving expensive cars ignored a pedestrian compared with only 30 percent of people driving more modest cars. In another experiment, a group of college students was asked if they would do unethical things in various everyday situations. Examples included taking printer paper from work and not telling a salesperson when he or she gave back more change. Students from higher-class families were more likely to act dishonestly. According to the scientists, rich people often think money can get them out of trouble. This makes them less afraid to take risks. It also means they care less about other people's feelings. Finally,it simply makes them greedier.\"Higher wealth status seems to make you want even more,and that increased want leads you to bend the rules or break the rules to serve your self-interest,\" said Paul Piff, leading scientist of the study.

A team headed by Professor Marina de Tommaso at the Neurophysiopathology Pain Unit asked a group of men and women to pick the 20 paintings they considered most ugly and most beautiful from a selection of 300 works by artists such as Lenoardo da Vinci and Sandro Botticelli. They were then asked to watch either the beautiful paintings, or the ugly paintings, or a blank panel while the team struck a short laser pulse at their hand, creating a sensation as if they had been hurt by a pin. The subjects rated the pain as being a third less intense while they were viewing the beautiful paintings, compared with when considering the ugly paintings or the blank panel. Electrodes   measuring the brain's electrical activity also confirmed a reduced response to the pain when the subject looked at beautiful paintings. While distractions , such as music, are known to reduce pain in hospital, Prof de Tommaso says this is the first result to show that beauty plays a part. The findings, reported in New Scientist, also go a long way to show that beautiful surroundings could aid the healing process. \"Hospitals have been designed to be functional, but we think that their aesthetic  aspects should be taken into account too,\" said the neurologist. \"Beauty obviously offers a distraction that ugly paintings do not. But at least there is no suggestion that ugly surroundings make the pain worse. I think these results show that more research is needed into how a beautiful environment can reduce suffering.\" Pictures they liked included Starry Night by Vincent Van Gogh and Botticellis' Birth of Venus. Pictures they found ugly included works by Pablo Picasso, the Italian 20th century artist Anonino Bueno and Columbian Fernando Botero. \"these people were not art experts so some of the pictures they found ugly would be considered masterpieces by the art world,\" said Prof de Tommaso.

        "input":"Technological change is everywhere and affects every aspect of life, mostly for the better. However, social changes are brought about by new technology are often mistaken for a change in attitudes. An example at hand is the involvement of parents in the lives of their children who are attending college. Surveys   on this topic suggests that parents today continue to be \"very\" or \"somewhat\" overly-protective even after their children move into college dormitories. The same surveys also indicate that the rate of parental involvement is greater today than it was a generation ago. This is usually interpreted as a sign that today's parents are trying to manage their children's lives past the point where this behavior is appropriate. However, greater parental involvement does not necessarily indicate that parents are failing to let go of their \"adult\" children. In the context   of this discussion, it seems valuable to first find out the cause of change in the case of parents' involvement with their grown children. If parents of earlier generations had wanted to be in touch with their college-age children frequently, would this have been possible? Probably not. On the other hand, does the possibility of frequent communication today mean that the urge to do so wasn't present a generation ago? Many studies show that older parents - today's grandparents - would have called their children more often if the means and cost of doing so had not been a barrier. Furthermore, studies show that finances are the most frequent subject of communication between parents and their college children. The fact that college students are financially dependent on their parents is nothing new; nor are requests for more money to be sent from home. This phenomenon is neither good nor bad; it is a fact of college life, today and in the past. Thanks to the advanced technology, we live in an age of bettered communication. This has many implications well beyondthe role that parents seem to play in the lives of their children who have left for college. But it is useful to bear in mind that all such changes come from the technology and not some imagined desire by parents to keep their children under their wings. The writer believes that   _  .\nA.parents today are more protective than those in the past\nB.the disadvantages of new technology outweigh its advantages\nC.technology explains greater parental involvement with their children\nD.parents' changed attitudes lead to college children's delayed independence\nAnswer:",

A study found releasing the strange expletive (=swearing) helped people cope with discomfort in the short-term but the frequency of swearing played an important role. Researchers at Keele University's School of Psychology employed 71 undergraduates who were asked to carry out a cold-water challenge while either repeating a swear word or a non-swear word. The students put their hand in room temperature water for three minutes to act as a control before diving it into cold 5degC water for as long as they could while repeating their word. The level of sensed pain together with a change in heart rate were compared while people swore or said their non-swear word. The group was also asked about how much they swore in daily life and this was analyzed together with their level of pain tolerance. Writing in the Journal of Pain, the authors concluded: \"Swearing increased pain tolerance and heart rate compared with not swearing.\" \"Moreover, the higher the daily swearing frequency, the less was the benefit for pain tolerance when swearing, compared with when not swearing.\" Dr Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele, said:  \"Swearing is a very emotive form of language and our findings suggest that using swear words moderation (, ) can be an effective and readily available short-term pain reliever.\" \"However, if you're used to swearing all the time, our research suggests you won't get the same effect.\" According to the passage, which of the statements is TRUE?\nA.The more frequently you swear, the better your ability to stand pain will be.\nB.The heart rate of the participants will be increasing while they are swearing in the experiment.\nC.If you repeat a swear word in moderation, you will relieve much of the pain for a long time.\nD.Swearing plays a very important role in relieving the pain and comforting yourself.\nAnswer:",

Co-discoverer Andrew Warren is hoping to raise at least $50,000 by auctioning  off the rights to name the 4-inch \"owl eye\" butterfly, which lives in Sonora, a Mexican state bordering Arizona. \"That would support at least two years of research for our team down in Mexico,\" Warren said. \"Money goes a long way down here in Mexico.\" According to the scientific tradition, discoverers of a new species have the say in naming it. In recent years, some discoverers have auctioned off their naming rights to raise money. Warren said the amount being sought for the butterfly is not out of the question, noting that naming rights for a new monkey species brought in $650,000 two years ago. A group of 10 new fish species that went on the naming auction block at the same time earlier this year brought in a total of $2 million.

There are about 1,000 hunting farms across America whose owners offer hunters an opportunity to kill animals that are kept in fenced areas. Russian boar, zebra, deer, antelope and many other species are raised just to be killed. Farm owners charge hunters thousands of dollars for animals that they kill, many of which are close to extinction  . The Humane Society of the United States says this type of hunting should be stopped because it is not fair to the animals. Many owners raise their animals. Others buy from animal dealers or from zoos and circuses that no longer want them. This means that the animals are not afraid of humans and they are easy to be shot by hunters. Owners of small ranches   keep their animals in fenced areas so that the hunters can get close to the animals before shooting at them. On large farms hunters are taken to areas where the animals are fed sometime of the day. This also makes it easy to kill the animals. The hunters want to keep the heads and chests of the animals they kill to hang as trophies   on their walls. This means that the animals are usually  shot in parts of the body. That means they will suffer a slow and painful death. The hunting is allowed across most of America but some parts of the country have stopped or restricted it. The Humane Society of the United States hopes that it won't be too long before the rest parts of the country also give up this cruel sport.

Once upon a time - July 20, 1969, to be specific - two men got out of their little spaceship and wandered around on the moon for a while.Ten more men walked on the moon over the next three and a half years. Unfortunately, not quite.A fair number of Americans think that this whole business of moon landings really isa fairy tale.They believe that the landings were a big hoax   staged in the Mojave Desert, to convince everyone that U.S.technology was the \"best\" in the whole wide world.    Which is the harder thing to do: Send men to the moon or make believe we did? The fact is the physics behind sending people to the moon is simple.You can do it with computers whose entire memory capacities can now fit on chips the size of postage stamps and that cost about as much as, well, a postage stamp.I know you can because we did. However, last fall NASA considered spending $15,000 on a public-relations campaign to convince the unimpressed that Americans had in fact gone to the moon.That idea was mostly a reaction to a Fox television program, first aired in February 2001, that claimed to expose the hoax.The show's creator is a publicity hound   who has lived up to the name in more ways than one by hounding Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon.Mr.X (as I will call him, thereby denying him the joyous sight of his name in print) recently followed Buzz Aldrin around and called him \"a thief, liar and coward\" until the 72-year-old astronaut finally lost it and hit the 37-year-old Mr.X in the face. Anyway, NASA's publicity campaign began to slow down.The nonbelievers took the campaign as NASA's effort to hide something while the believers said that $15,000 to convince people that the world was round -- I mean, that we had gone to the moon -- was simply a waste of money.(Actually, the $15,000 was supposed to pay for an article by James E.Oberg, an astronomy writer who, with Aldrin, has contributed to Scientific American.) If NASA not paying Oberg, perhaps it could put the money to good use by hiring two big guys to drag Neil Armstrong out of the house.Armstrong is an extremely private man, but he is also the first man on the moon, so maybe he has a duty to be a bit more outspoken about the experience.Or NASA could just buy Aldrin a commemorate plaque   for his recent touch on the face of Mr.X.

However, we often unconsciously do the opposite, which may not be regarded as returning kindness with ingratitude, but have the equal power to harm each other. In particular, the closer the relationship is, the more determined we are. Jennifer, my friend Randy's mother, is already over 70, poor eyesight and weak legs. But due to her character, she chose to live alone in the suburbs. No matter how busily Randy works, he would go there to visit her once or twice every week. That day as soon as he parked his car, Randy smelt the delicious smell of meat coming from her mother's house. His mother said, \"Your birthday is coming next week, so I'm preparing pork trotters   for you!\" Seeing the steaming delicious trotters, he couldn't help complaining, \"I don't like these things at all, so fatty.\" On his way back, he called me, saying that he felt sorry. In fact, he longed to thank his mother and eat up that bowl of trotters. But he felt sorry that it took her too much time and energy. If he didn't stop her strictly, he was afraid the same thing would continue. He would rather not eat trotters any more than have his mother overwork. I understand how he felt exactly. Each of us has done like that. Because of feeling sorry for others' sacrifice, we purposely harden our heart against accepting others' favor and even criticize them severely in order to frighten their goodness away and make them never do that again. This method may work, but it will hurt each other's feelings. It's not wrong logically, but we always neglect another sound deep in our heart: because we're afraid we can't repay them, we're unwilling to shoulder others' goodness. So we reduce its value and refuse it severely. But to destroy others' goodness is also to deny you.

It charges libraries per book per copy and gives publishers a cut of the total income. From the consumer's point of view, this means that if more than five people want the latest Danielle Steel romance novel, other people who request that book will get a message saying the title is unable to get. Many publishers seem to have embraced its model. More than 350 publishers gave the company rights to hand out their digital works, and McGraw-Hill Corporation and Houghton Mifflin Corporation have put money into the company. The California public libraries and about 1,800 others across the US are trying out the Net Library service. Some librarians criticize the Net Library model. Stanford University librarian Michael Keller argues that the company is creating an unnatural fear of digital works, which is contrary to the ideas of the Internet. Keller and some other librarians argue for the e-book vision set forth by Brary. Brary is starting a service that lets us users read books for free. But it will charge about 25 cents a page when a person tries to point out material or copy and taste it into a different file or tries to download a copy onto a computer. Christopher Warnock, chief executive of Brary, believes most consumers won't want to buy entire books, only the parts that interest them. \"There is not really a lot of good owning an electronic file and having to store it and manage it.

Here's an example to show how honorable actions create happiness. Say a store clerk fails to charge us for an item.If we keep silent,and profit from the clerk's mistake,we would drive home with a sense of sneaky   excitement.Later we might tell our family or friends about our good fortune.On the other hand,if we tell the clerk about the uncharged item,the clerk would be grateful and thank us for our honesty.We would leave the store with a quiet sense of honor that we might never share with another soul. Then,what is it to do with our sense of happiness? In the first case,where we don't tell the clerk,a couple of things would happen.Deep down inside we would know ourselves as a type of thief.In the process,we would lose some peace of  mind  and  selfrespect.We  would also demonstrate that we cannot be trusted,since we advertise our dishonor by telling our family and friends.We damage our own reputations by telling others.In contrast, _ causes  different  things  to happen.Immediately the clerk knows us to be honorable.Upon leaving the store,we feel honorable and our selfrespect is increased.Whenever we take honorable actions we gain the deep internal rewards of goodness and a sense of nobility. There is a beautiful positive cycle that is created by living a life of honorable actions.Honorable  thoughts lead  to honorable actions.Honorable actions lead us to a happier existence.And it's easy to think and act honorably again when we're happy.While the positive cycle can be difficult to start,once it's started,it's easy to continue.Keeping on doing good deeds brings us peace of mind,which is important for our happiness.

It is said that we share 40 per cent of our genetic structure with the simple worm. But that fact has helped Sir John Sulston win the 2002 Nobel Prize for Medicine. Sir John is the founder of the Sanger Institute in Cambridge, which was set up in 1992 to get further understanding of the human genome . To help them do this, they turned to the worm. The nematode worm is one of the earliest creatures on planet earth. It is less than one millimeter long, completely transparent and spends its entire life digging holes through sand. But it still has lots to say about human life, and what can be done to make it better. What the worm told Sir John and his colleagues was that each of the cells in the human body is programmed like a computer. They grow, develop and die according to a set of instructions that are coded in our genetic make-up. Many of the diseases that humans suffer from happen when these instructions go wrong or are not obeyed. When the cell refuses to die but carries on growing instead, this leads to cancer. Heart attacks and diseases like AIDS cause more cell deaths than normal, increasing the damage they do to the body. Sir John was the first scientist to prove the existence of programmed cell death.

        "input":"Are you a problem shopper? The answer is \"Yes\", if you or someone else thinks that you sometimes get carried away with shopping. In other words, do you or does someone else think you are occupied in extreme shopping? If people have regrets later about their shopping, or have an \"out-of-control\" feeling about the quantities of what they buy or the amount of credit they use, they may be considered to be problem shoppers. Extreme shopping can lead to a more serious problem - addictive shopping. Addictive shoppers feel driven by the desire to shop and spend money. They experience great tension which drives them to shop and spend money and they feel a \"rush\" during the time they are occupied with the shopping activity. Extreme or addictive shopping may result from long-time unpleasant feelings, of which anxiety, pain and shame are common ones. When we feel bad inside, we often do something to make ourselves feel better. In this case, we often go shopping. A few people shop to relieve their boredom or emptiness. For some people, the motivation is a desire for status, power, beauty or success. Some love to shop as it makes them feel valued in the eyes of the shop assistants. Others shop simply because it makes them forget, at least temporarily, tension, fear or unhappiness in their life. Besides, shopping malls are designed to encourage continual shopping. For instance, there are some malls where you can't see clocks displaying the time because they don't want you to become too aware of the time you spend there. What's more, food courts, coffee shops and restrooms are provided, so you don't have to leave the mall because of your physical needs. Therefore, once you become aware of how market forces work, you will certainly come to control your shopping behavior. For example, how much time you will spend and what areas you will visit can be decided before you enter the mall. Keep a written account of what items you will buy and how much money you will spend. Make a plan for what you are going to buy before you feel the urge to shop and then stick to it. That is vital for gaining self-control.

Researchers from the University of Chicago asked volunteers to remember simple words.Many found their memories letting them down towards the end of the day, but the following morning, those who had slept well could recall much more. Researchers, writing in the journal Nature, said the brain could \"rescue\" lost memories during the night. When the brain is first asked to remember something that memory is laid down in an \"unstable\" state, meaning that it is possible that it could be lost.At some point, the brain consolidates those it deems important into a \"stable\", more permanent state.However, the Chicago researchers suggested that it was possible for a \"stable\" memory to be made \"unstable\" again.This would mean that memories could be modified then filed away again in the face of new experiences. The 12 volunteers tested in the experiment were played words created through a speech synthesizer which were purposely difficult to understand.Initially, the written version of the word  from the audio version only.Tests revealed that the ability to recall the right word tended to tail off as the day ended. However, when the volunteers were retested after a good night's sleep, they were able to recall some words that they had \" forgotten\" the previous evening. Dr Daniel, one of the study authors, said: \"Sleep consolidates memories, protecting them against subsequent interference or decay.Sleep also appears to \"recover\" or restore memories.\" He said: \"If performance is reduced by decay, sleep might actively recover what has been lost.\" Dr Karim Nader, from the Department of Psychology in McGill University in Montreal, said: \"Memory research is undergoing a transformation---no longer is memory thought to be a hard-writing of the brain, instead it seems to be a process of storage and restorage.\" Sleep helps some memories \"mature\" and also prunes out unimportant memories.

Watson has, indeed, been to Afghanistan. Later, he asks Holmes about it. Holmes explains that there is nothing magical about what he does. He gets to know it all by very, very careful observation . Observation One Watson was introduced to Holmes as a doctor. Yet Holmes thought that the way he stood and walked made him seem like a soldier. So, this meant he was probably an army doctor. Observation Two Watson's face was quite dark skinned. But his wrists were pale. So his dark face was probably sun burnt. This meant that he had been to a hot, sunny country.

Unlike marine   mammals,which have a layer of blubber  to keep them  warm,penguins depend on their waterproof feathers.Without them,Pierre was unwilling to jump into the swimming pool and ended up trembling on the side of the pool while his 19 peers played in the water. \"He was cold:he would shake,\"said Pam Schaller,a senior biologist.Schaller first tried a heat lamp to keep Pierre warm.Then she got another idea:if wetsuits keep humans warm in the cold Pacific,why not make one for Pierre? Schaller designed the suit,which covered Pierre's body and had small openings for his flippers. \"I would walk behind him and look at where there were any gaps.and cut and refit until it looked like it was extremely suitable.\"she said. One concern was that the other penguins would reject Pierre in his new suit,but in fact,they accepted his new look.He swam freely and got along with others well,although he was the only penguin with a black stomach. Schaller couldn't say for sure whether the wetsuit allowed Pierre to recover his fine feathers,but\" certainly we were able to keep him comfortable during a period of time that would have been very difficult for him to stay comfortable\". Pierre will take off his suit after his new feathers grow back. Schaller followed Pierre in order to see  _  .\nA.whether other penguins would reject him\nB.if anywhere of wetsuit needed to be cut and refit\nC.if the wetsuit kept warm\nD.whether the wetsuit would keep the feathers from recovering\nAnswer:",

        "input":"A child, who has once got interested in a tale, likes, as a rule, to have it retold in almost the same words, but this should not lead parents to treat printed fairy stories as formal texts. It is always much better to \"tell\" a story than just \"read\" it out of a book, and, if a parent can produce his own as an improvement on the printed text, according to his child's actual situation, so much the better. There is a charge made against some fairy tales, as they probably harm children by frightening them or leaving them sad feelings. To prove it, an experiment has been done to show that children who have heard terrible fairy stories often feel more uneasy than those who have not. As for fears, there are some cases where children get timid   by some fairy story. Often, however, this arises from the child having heard the story once. Familiarity with the story by repetition may weaken the pain of fear. There are also people who object to fairy stories on the grounds that the stories are not objectively true, and that those giants, witches, two-headed dragons, magic carpets etc. do not really exist, so children should be taught to learn the reality by studying history, instead of being got fond of the strange side in fairy tales. Those, who prefer to create such stories, are so peculiar   that it is hard to argue with them. If their creative exaggeration   were _ , the world should be full of mad men attempting to fly from New York to Philadelphia on a stick or covering a telephone with kisses in the belief that it was their beloved girl-friend. Not once is a fairy story ever declared to be a description of the real world, but not every child is clever enough to be aware of it. Parents should choose their children's \"bed-time\" reading materials with much care. Only the fairy stories containing positive effect will make a clever and caring child with rich imagination. One of the reasons why some people are not in favor of fairy tales is that   _  .\nA.they are made up far from the truth\nB.they are so full of imagination\nC.they are not interesting at all\nD.they make history difficult to teach\nAnswer:",

        "input":"There are various aspects that go into making a successful school, and success can be measured in various ways. Often, the teachers are praised for a school's success and blamed for its failure. Yet, in order for a school to be effective, it must be a place where teaching and learning can easily take place, and that requires the hard work of more than just educators. Students must take learning into their own hands and feel as if what they are doing is as important as it actually is. This can only be done with the cooperation of every adult that is involved in the students' life. Some of these individuals often go unnoticed, yet the role they play in the students' lives is immeasurable. In the school, administrative assistants greet students at the start of the day and answer a large quantity of questions. When an assistant remembers a student's name or even something special about that student, it communicates to him that he is cared for. The assistant can also give that extra encouragement for a student to make better choices, especially when they are visiting the principal's office. Meanwhile, though cafeteria workers have a short space of time to interact with students, they can make a big difference as well. Beyond meeting nutritional needs, cafeteria workers may also on occasion meet the emotional needs of the students they serve. Students benefit from positive interaction with adults, and cafeteria workers may give that extra bit of encouragement that a child needs. Custodians   are usually underappreciated for what they offer to schools. They have to be knowledgeable about everything from cleaning to fixing the most intricate   tools. They get to school early in the morning before teachers arrive and lock up late at night after the last student has left from the after-school event. They also make sure teachers are equipped with the necessary items and prepare the rooms so that they are ready for learning. A great custodian also gives that kind word or extra smile to that student who needs it most. Which of the following is TRUE about cafeteria workers?\nA.It's enough for them to cook for the students.\nB.It's hard for them to interact with the students.\nC.They have the most interaction with students at school.\nD.They can also meet the emotional needs of the students.\nAnswer:",

This is an excerpt from Oprah Winfrey's 2008 Stanford Commencement   Address: A year after I left college, I was given the opportunity to co-anchor   the 6 o'clock news in Baltimore...Yet, it didn't feel right. The first sign, as President Hennessy was saying, was when they tried to change my name. The news director said to me at the time: \"Nobody's going to remember Oprah. So, we want to change your name. We've come up with a name we think that people will remember and people will like. It's a friendly name: Suzie.\"... I grew up not loving the name, but once I was asked to change it, I thought, well, it is my name and do I look like a Suzie to you? So, I thought, no, it doesn't feel right. I'm not going to change my name. And if people remember it or not, that's OK. And then they said they didn't like the way I looked... So, they sent me to a salon where they gave me a perm  , and after a few days all my hair fell out and I had to shave my head. And then they really didn't like the way I looked, because now I am black and bald and sitting on TV. Not a pretty picture. But even worse than being bald, I really hated, hated, hated being sent to report on other people's tragedies as a part of my daily duty, knowing that I was just expected to observe, when everything in my instinct told me that I should be doing something, (and that) I should be lending a hand... It felt right. And that's where everything that followed for me began. And after eight months, I lost that job. They said I was too emotional. I was too much. But since they didn't want to pay out the contract, they put me on a talk show in Baltimore. And the moment I sat down on that show, the moment I did, I felt like I'd come home. I realized that TV could be more than just a playground, but a platform for service, for helping other people's lives improve. And the moment I sat down, doing that talk show, it felt like breathing. And I got that lesson. When you're doing the work you're meant to do, it feels right and every day is a bonus  , regardless of what you're getting paid.

The bubble is intended to create an atmosphere with adequate oxygen and other essential elements. But similar bubble-like structures have also been constructed on earth. One of the most famous, and controversial, is a site in the Arizona desert. Biosphere 2, as it is called, was built not far from Tucson in 1984 and is now run by Columbia University. This huge(7,200,000-cubic-foot)glass and steel construction contains several separate ecosystems, including a desert, a rain forest, and a 900,000-gallon \"ocean.\" The climatic conditions-humidity, temperature, air quality-are regulated by sensors and can be adjusted as needed or desired. For example, a rainstorm can be created to increase the humidity. The adjustable features of Biosphere 2 make it an ideal location to perform experiments to help determine the effects of such climatic changes as global warming. The current conditions at Biosphere 2 are vastly different from those in 1993, when eight people who had moved into the environment with great fanfare two years earlier moved out in failure. Though promising to be self-sufficient , these \"colonists\" had so much trouble regulating the environment that they reportedly had food smuggled into them.

On the wall are maps, crisscrossed with brightly colors arrows that painstakingly track the fearsome path of the enemy. What kind of invader gives rise to such high-level monitoring? Not man, not beast, but the lowly desert locust . In recent months, billions of the 3-inch-long winged warriors have descended on Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia, blackening the sky and eating up crops and vegetation. The insect invasion, the worst in 30 years, is already creating great destruction in the Middle East and is now treating southern Europe. The current crisis began in late 1985 near the Red Sea. Unusually rainy weather moistened the sands of the Sudan, making them ideal seedbed for the locust, which lays its eggs in the earth. The insect onslaught threatens to create yet another African famine. Each locust can eat its weight (not quite a tenth of an ounce) in vegetation every 24 hours. A good-size swarm of 50 billion insects eats up 100,000 tons of grass, trees and crops in a single night. All $150 million may be needed this year. The U.S. has provided two spraying planes and about 50,000 gal. of pesticide. The European Community has donated $3.8 million in aid and the Soviet Union, Canada, Japan and China have provided chemical-spraying aircraft to help wipe out the pests. But relief efforts are hampered by the relative mildness of approved pesticides, which quickly lose their deadly punch and require frequent replications. The most effective locust killer dieldrin has been linked to cancer and is banned by many Western countries and some of the affected African nations. More than 5 million acres have been dusted with locust-killing chemicals; another 5 million will be treated by the end of June.

        "input":"A world-famous Canadian author, Margaret Atwood, has created the world's first long-distance signing device , the LongPen. After many tiring book-signing tours from city to city, Atwood thought there must be a better way to do them. She hired some technical experts and started her own company in 2004. Together they designed the LongPen. Here's how it works: The author writes a personal message and signature on a computer tablet  using a special pen. On the receiving end, in another city, a robotic arm fitted with a regular pen signs the book. The author and fan can talk with each other via webcams  and computer screens. Work on the LongPen began in Atwood's basement . At first, they had no idea it would be as hard as it turned out to be. The device went through several versions, including one that actually had smoke coming out of it. The investing finally completed, test runs were made in Ottawa, and the LongPen was officially launched at the 2006 London Book Fair. From here , Atwood conducted two transatlantic book signings of her latest book for fans in Toronto and New York City. The LongPen produces a unique signature each time because it copies the movement of the author in real time. It has several other potential applications. It could increase credit card security and allow people to sign contracts from another province. The video exchange between signer and receiver can be recorded on DVD for proof when legal documents are used. \"It's really fun\", said the owner of a bookstore, who was present for one of the test runs. \"Obviously you can't shake hands with the author, but there are chances for a connection that you don't get from a regular book signing.\" The response to the invention has not been all favorable. Atwood has received criticism from authors who think she is trying to end book tours. But she said, \"It will be possible to go to places that you never got sent to before because the publishers couldn't afford it.\" Why did Atwood decide to invent the LongPen?\nA.To set up her own company.\nB.To win herself greater popularity.\nC.To write her books in a new way.\nD.To make book signings less tiring.\nAnswer:",

        "input":"What Is Today's American Dream They may not have called it the American Dream, but for centuries people have gone to America in search of freer, happier, and richer lives. But is today's American Dream a mythical concept or still a reality? Isabel Belarsky's tiny Brooklyn apartment fills with the sound of her father's voice. Sidor Belarsky sings an Aria in Russian and 90-year-old Isabel, her lips painted an elegant red, sways gently to the song coming from her stereo. Isabel speaks with pride about her father's talent and his success as an opera singer: Albert Einstein was such a fan she says that he invited Sidor to accompany him on his speaking engagements and would ask him to sing to the audience. How the Belarskys came to be in America is an extraordinary tale that Isabel loves to tell. It was the offer of a six-month job by a Mormon college president, who had seen Sidor singing in Leningrad, that enabled the Belarskys to escape from Stalin's Russia in 1930. \"Our dream was being in America,\" Isabel says. \"They loved it. My mother could never think of Russia, it was her enemy and my father, he made such a wonderful career here.\" Like generations of immigrants before them, the Belarskys came to America in search of freedom--to them the American Dream meant liberty. But Isabel says it promised even more. \"The dream is to work, to have a home and to get ahead. You can start as a janitor and become the owner of the building.\" The American Dream is not written into the constitution but it is so ingrained in the national psyche that it might as well be. Many point to the second sentence in the Declaration of Independence--the \"certain unalienable rights\" that include \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" as the \"official\" version of the phrase. But it was actually in 1931 that the term was popularized, when historian James Truslow Adams wrote in The Epic of America that the Dream means \"a better, richer, and happier life for all our citizens of every rank\". The concept of the American Dream has not stayed static. For European immigrants, like Isabel, fleeing persecution in the first half of the last century, the Dream was about a life without persecution.  But somewhere in the middle of the last century the dream changed. As America's post war economy boomed, the new arrivals wanted more than freedom--they wanted a share of the prosperity as well.  In the 1950s, TV commercials featured housewives proudly showing off kitchens filled with gleaming appliances. The quest for liberation became a quest for Coca Cola. As the century wore on, the materialistic slant of the dream overtook the political side. Dallas and Dynasty suggested this was a country where it was possible to become not just rich, but filthily rich. Cheyanne Smith was shocked at the deprivation that greeted her in America. She arrived in New York from the Caribbean seven years ago. Having watched endless American TV shows as a child, she thought she knew what to expect when her family moved to Brooklyn. Instead, the deprivation of one of New York's poorest neighbourhoods shocked her. \"I thought this is not America because this is not what I see on television,\" she says. Like Cheyanne, 18-year-old Franscisco Curiel is also ambitious. He came from Mexico City three years ago to go to college here but he's worried that Brooklyn's schools aren't going to give him a good enough education. \"The system is broken; we can't get the superior education that they supposedly want to give us,\" he says. Through the centuries America's immigrants have endured terrible hardship and sacrifice so that they and their children can get ahead. Perhaps it's not surprising to hear the members of the Bushwick youth group lament the multiple, low paid jobs that their parents must do simply to get the rent paid and put food on the table. What is startling is that these bright, ambitious youngsters just don't believe that talent and hard work are enough to ensure they will ever have a shot at that mythical American Dream. What can be inferred from the passage?\nA.The American Dream is deeply-rooted in the national psyche.\nB.The concept of the American Dream has gone through changes throughout the time.\nC.American Dream is still firmly believed by the majority of the immigrants.\nD.The concept of American Dream will remain unchanged in the next two decades.\nAnswer:",

When my brother and I were growing up, we mowed  yards during the summer to earn pocket change. Dad was our salesman. He told our neighbors about our service and offered a price they could not refuse. My brother and I got $ 10 per yard. I later found out that our friends were charging $ 20 or more for the same amount of work. Every time we headed out to mow lawns , Dad was there to watch. I used to wonder why he came with us. He stood supervising  our work in the heat when he could have been inside relaxing with air conditioning and an icy drink. One day we were cutting our next-door neighbor's yard, he always waited until the grass was knee-high to call us over. To make matters worse, we had an old lawn mower. This particular afternoon, I was finishing up and was tired and sweaty. I was just about to cut off the lawn mower when I saw Dad pointing to one piece of grass. He yelled, \"You missed a piece.\" I frowned, hoping he would let it slide and let me go home. He kept pointing. So, tired and disappointed, I went back to cut that piece of grass. I said to myself, \"That one piece isn't hurting anyone. Why won't he just let it go?\" But when I reached adulthood, I understood his message ---When you're running a business, the work you do says a great deal about you. If you want to be seen as an entrepreneur  with honesty, you must deliver a quality product. That single blade of grass meant the job was not done.

Without the forest cover, these areas would reflect more heat into the atmosphere,warming the rest of the world .Losing the rainforests may also influence wind and rainfall patterns, potentially causing certain natural disasters  all over the world. In the past hundred years, humans have begun destroying rainforests in search of three major resources  : land for crops, wood for paper and other products, land for raising farm animals. This action affects the environment as a whole. For example,a lot of carbon dioxide in the air comes from burning the rainforests. People obviously have a need for the resources we gain from cutting trees but we will suffer much more than we will benefit . There are two main reasons for _ . Firstly, when people cut down trees, generally they can only use the land for a year or two. Secondly, cutting large sections of rainforests may provide a good supply of wood right now, but in the long run  it actually reduces the world' s wood supply. Rainforests are often called the world's drug store. More than 25% of the medicines we use today come from plants in rainforests.

I'm 30, and I've been on Facebook since March of 2004, which makes me one of the website's earliest users. At first, I used it obsessively. If I had a free moment, I'd log on to see whether my friends had updated their profiles. I'd sit alone scrolling through these updates and then run into someone at a coffee shop and have nothing to say because I already knew everything about them, and they knew everything about me. In November, I went to my ten!year high school reunion and was not pleasantly surprised. Lauren became a model, Josh went to law school, Dina was a teacher. I hadn't talked to any of them since graduation, but I knew exactly what they were doing, both now and last week. But lately, I'm overwhelmed . Facebook opened up to everyone, not just college students, and my co!workers started to join, which meant they now knew what I was doing when I wasn't at work. And as a rule: you can NOT make friends with your coworkers because then they'll ask you the next day. But I thought we were friends.

Most gift--giving (and getting) shows nothing more than the spirit of love and friendship. But it is possible to form some connections between the kinds of things brought and the people who buy them. Here is a guide to who gives what and why.         The clothes you wear tell something about your personality. They tell the world not only how you want to be seen but how you see yourself as well. When someone gives you something to wear that agrees with your self-image, they're saying, \"I agree with you. I like you the way you are. \" Such a gift should be taken as a form of compliment . On the other hand, a gift of clothing that doesn't match your personality could be an insult to your character.         Making something by hand has become the exception in many countries today. If you receive a homemade gift, you're lucky. It may not be made perfectly, but it will show a certain quality of love. They've given time and emotion, two important characteristics of being creative.        A person who thinks of food when thinking of gifts is a good example of what human warmth means. Whether you give a box of chocolate, a bag of oranges, or a ball of cheese, all carry the same message of comfort and support.        People who give books as gifts either like reading or would like everyone to think they do. If you happen to receive a large heavy book, its giver may be much more interested in the way things appear than in the way they actually are. Of course, reading is a way of new things. Giving a book can be a way of sharing a feeling or newly learned meaning. The giver is probably trying to say to you what the book said to him.

Contigiani, 62, a one-time high-powered manager, is now an ambassador for the slow life movement around the world. He started the first World Slow Day in 2007 to encourage the values of living and working at a more natural pace, and to make people rethink their daily lifestyle. Contigiani's association suggests \"14 commandments   \" for living better, such as waking up five minutes earlier to enjoy breakfast without rushing. Others include walking whenever possible, and reading in the evenings instead of watching television. This year, Contigiani left Italy where the event has spread around the country for Shanghai, one of the fastest moving cities in the world. The slow-living supporter said he wandered around the busiest streets of the commercial center for an entire afternoon, inviting people to \"slow down\". \"Among the '14 commandments', the one about waking up five minutes earlier was the most popular by far, \" Contigiani said. Back in Italy, the now well-known event hosts a lot of activities, such as reminding people to stop and smell the roses. In central Milan you would probably be fined if you walk too fast. In parks and public spaces, free yoga and Tai Chi   lessons are important parts of the events. Italian farmers' union noted that Italians spent less and less time preparing meals, a habit connected to rising levels of obesity .

        "input":"One important variable affecting communication across cultures is destiny   and personal responsibility. This refers to the degree to which we feel ourselves the masters of our lives, contrary to the degree to which we see ourselves as _ to things outside our control. Another way to look at this is to ask how much we see ourselves able to change and act, to choose the course of our lives and relationships. Some have drawn a parallel between the personal responsibility in North American settings and the view itself. The North American view is vast, with large spaces of unpopulated land. The frontier attitude of \"King\" of the wilderness, and the expansiveness of the land reaching huge distances, may relate to generally high levels of confidence in the ability to shape and choose our destinies. In this expansive land, many children grow up with a heroic sense of life, where ideas are big, and hope springs forever. When they experience temporary failures, they are encouraged to redouble their efforts, to \"Try, try again.\" Action, efficiency, and achievement are valued and expected. Free will is respected in laws and enforced by courts. Now consider places in the world with much smaller land, whose history reflects wars and tough struggles: Northern Ireland, Mexico, Israel, Palestine. In these places, destiny's role is more important in human life. In Mexico, there is a history of hard life, fighting over land, and loss of homes. Mexicans are more likely to see struggles as part of their life and unavoidable. Their passive attitude is expressed in their way of responding to failure or an accident by saying \"ni modo\" (\"no way\" or \"tough lick\"), meaning that the failure was destined. This variable is important to understanding cultural conflicts. If someone believing in free will crosses paths with someone more passive, miscommunication is likely. The first person may expect action and responsibility. Failing to see it, he may conclude that the second is lazy, not cooperative, or dishonest. The second person will expect respect for the natural order of things. Failing to see it, he may conclude that the first is forcible, rude, or big headed in his ideas of what can be accomplished or changed. The author would probably agree that   _  .\nA.vast land may lead to a more controllable desire\nB.heroic sense of life roots deeply in a small country\nC.living in limited space contributes to an accepting attitude\nD.fighting over land helps people gain high levels of confidence\nAnswer:",

Now you have the chance to start fresh and do things more intelligently. I built my business on an unstable structure. I kept it going for years, but the business collapsed last year. I had to leave my office, selling off all the furniture and equipment. I got kicked out of my apartment because I couldn't pay the rent. I couldn't pay my bills or debt. I declared bankruptcy.  For years there was the worry that this might happen if I didn't keep straining  to keep the business going. And my worries were right. What I worried about would happen did happen .But you know what? Going through that experience wasn't really so bad. It was interesting. Some of it was actually pretty easy. Throughout most of it, I felt increasing relief and a renewed sense of freedom and possibility. All the old _ was gone. No more office. Fewer possessions. Fewer obligations. No more debt. Most of all , no more straining. Life became a lot easier. I got a cheaper and smaller apartment. I became debt-free. I learned to live within my means. Those were actually good things. The others were just feelings. The reality wasn't actually painful. After that, I kept going with the same business but completely changed the business model. I avoided the earlier mistakes, and that business recovered just fine and worked great. It was profitable every year from then on. But I had to go through the collapse first to reach that point.

At the international terminal for Northwest Airlines at John F. Kennedy International Airport inprefix = st1 \/New York, passengers waited up to 30 minutes longer than usual.

Police officer Wang Shaoyan came under the spotlight this month after his child took part in an 18-kilometer race in the Hubei provincial capital. Some parents attacked his methods of extreme physical training, while others reacted strongly to his admission that he regularly exposes the youngster to cold showers. \"I just want my son to reach his full potential,\" Wang said, adding that 4-year-old son not only runs 3 km every day he also takes cold showers from time to time to strengthen his body's resistance and willpower. \"He has never taken any sick leave from kindergarten,\" he said proudly. However, some parents find his methods too extreme. \"I'm not sure a 4-year-old is prepared for such intense training,\" said Zhang Ruxia  a woman who gave birth to two boys in October in Tianjin. \"You can have good intentions to train your child at an early age but you also have to consider whether he can take it.\" Wang responded by saying children are too young to make decisions, and it is up to parents to lead them on the right path. \"I read many materials before and the whole process is step-by-step without pushing or imposing on my son,\" Wang said. The father said he was not acting rashly but following a scientific way of education. He said the doubts about his methods reflect the declining standards of modern education. \"Many people in Japan give their children cold showers too ,and no one is fussing about it,\" he said.

Though there are some sayings about its origin, all agree that the word Nian, which in modern Chinese means \"year\", was originally the name of a beast that started to eat people the night before the beginning of a new year. One story goes that the beast Nian had a very big mouth that would take in a great many people at one time. People were very afraid. One day, an old man came to their help and said he would stop all this. He said to Nian, \"I hear that you are very strong, but can you eat up all the beasts on earth instead of people who are too weak to be your enemies?\" \"Yes,\" Nian agreed with him and went to kill many of the beasts on earth. People were very happy because those beasts also did bad things to people and killed their farm animals from time to time. After that, the old man, who was a god, rode on the beast Nian and left. Nian was gone, and other beasts also went into forests; people began to enjoy their happy life. Before the old man left, he had told people to put up red paper-cuts on their windows and doors at each year's end to drive Nian away, because red is the color the beast felt most afraid of. From then on, every year at the beginning of spring, people prepare to \"Guo Nian\". The word \"Guo Nian\" means \"go through the Nian safely\".

He told this story about himself: he began earning $125 a week at the age of 23. That was a lot of money in those days. Young Momand was very proud of his riches. He got married and moved with his wife to Long Island, outside New York City. But just moving there was not enough. For when Momand and his wife saw that their neighbors belonged to a country club they too joined a club. And when he saw that rich people were expected to ride horses, Momand went horseback riding every day. Momand and his wife also hired a servant and gave grand parties for their new neighbors. It was like a race, but one could never finish this race because one was always trying to keep up. Momand and his wife could not do that. The race ended for them when they could no longer pay for their new way of life. They moved back to an inexpensive New York City apartment. Momand later said that his experience had been a cruel awakening for him. However, he was able to see the funny side of it. He looked around him and noticed that many people do things just to keep up with their neighbors. He decided that this would make good stories for many papers across the country. He called it \"Keeping up with the Joneses\", because \"Jones\" is a very common American name. \"Keeping up with the Joneses\" came to mean keeping up with the people around you. Momand's stories appeared in different newspapers for over 28 years. People never seem to tire of keeping up with the Joneses. That is one reason why they read the \"right\" books, go to the \"right\" universities and eat in the \"right\" restaurants. But no matter what one does, Mr. Jones always seems to be ahead.

We even need to respect our enemies, because they help us to grow up and be stronger. Respect is one of the crucial values in a relationship. *Love Love is everything. With love in our hearts, we feel no need to hurt another. With love in our hearts, we will pay more attention to the similarities in opinions rather than the disagreement. If we want others to be good to us, we need to be good to them. After all, we give love to get love, right? *Loyalty People often forget the meaning and importance of loyalty . Loyalty is necessary for people to believe in each other. In no matter what kind of relationship, we need to believe in each other so that we can work together towards the same goal. *Honesty Honesty is to show other people who we really are. Honesty helps us do better, because it makes us realize our problems and find ways to solve them. It is this honesty, that will make others help you out, not because you need it.

But there may be a benefit to doing so, as a study has found that 3D films exercise the brain and improve short-term functioning in a similar way to brain-training tests. The research found that people who watched a movie in 3D improved cognitive   skills, compared to those who watched it in 2D. The research was led by neuroscientist  Dr Patrick Fagan from Goldsmiths University in London. More than 100 people took part in the experiment, where participants watched Disney filmBig Hero 6in either standard format or RealD 3D. They also carried out a brain-training-style test before and after seeing a section from the film. The test covered memory, reaction times and cognitive function and the results were compared later. According to the research, which was carried out in partnership with science group Thrill Laboratory, participants experienced a 23 percent increase in cognitive processing, as well as an 11 percent increase in reaction times. Dr Fagan said that the results showed enough of an improvement in brain function to suggest that 3D could play a part in improving brain power in the future. \"These findings are more significant than you might think,\" he said. \"It is a fact that people are living longer and there is a noticeable decline in cognitive brain function in old age which can worsen future quality of life. There has never been a better time to look at ways to improve brain function. The initial results of this study show that 3D films may potentially play a role in slowing this decline.\" A second part of the experiment involved those watching the film being fitted with headsets that scanned brain activity and this too showed heightened   activity when watching 3D. According to the results, participants were seven percent more engaged with what they were watching, adding to argument that 3D movies are more like watching real-life--something Professor Brendan Walker from Thrill Laboratory agreed with. \"As Professor Brendan Walker's test concluded, 3D films are more attractive and heighten the senses -- this, in turn, makes the brain run at quicker speeds,\" Dr Fagan said. According to the research, people watching a movie in 3D   _  .\nA.have a good exercise for their brain\nB.lose their short memory of its plots\nC.are willing to pay a high price for tickets\nD.react the same way as those watching it in 2D\nAnswer:",

Then there are the experienced travellers who have been playing cards with the same group over the last decade or so.

Travelling by public transport is being in the thick of the seasons of life -- a sweaty life in summer where people, blissfully unaware of the rivers of sweat running down their brows and inside their clothes. At the first smell of a perfumed man or woman boarding the stuffy bus or train, most people feel they are reborn. During the rains you can't avoid getting wet or muddied. The windows, almost always, are not a perfect fit and if you're not drenched by a sudden, heavy rain shower then you are bound to catch a jet spray of muddy water caused by a fellow motorist driving fast through a puddle. Rains are a perfect time for people to switch their old umbrellas for new ones. Since there are so many that look alike, it's impossible to tell whose is whose. Winter is the time when it feels good -- or at least warm -- to be part of a crowd. It is amazing how much the collective breaths of a 100 or so people can raise the freezing temperature inside. Looking at the masses dressed in their bright red pullovers or green coats, it's fun to imagine what faces lie beneath their dark woolen hats. The cold winter passes, making way for spring.

Last week, the Olympics minister Tessa Jowell announced a public competition to design a typically British garden within London's new Olympic park. Jowell said the idea behind the competition was to show off to the world one of the nation's favorite hobbies. It's likely the government also hopes that the competition will inspire more Brits to take an interest in the Olympics. It's a good plan, as the British love gardens almost as much as they love tea.     In many ways gardening defines Brits, perhaps because they are some of the world's keenest gardeners. The garden is seen as a private place in the UK. Most Brits would far rather sit in their garden than visit a park. They see their garden as an extension of their house outdoors, which is why so many Brits are as garden-proud as they are house-proud. There also seems to be something about the nourishing  act of gardening that appeals to the nation's gentle temperament . Interestingly, gardening has never been as widely enjoyed as it is today in Britain. Its growing popularity is no doubt due to people's increased awareness of the environment and the success of several popular gardening programs. Historically, Brits are also skilful gardeners. As Jowell noted when she made her announcement, if gardening were an Olympic sport then green-fingered Brits \"would win gold, silver and bronze.\" Of course, the irony  of Brits' passion for gardening is that their climate is so wet that there are very few months in the year they can sit outside and enjoy their gardens. In fact, it may be the very valuableness of these few warm months that make gardens so prized and valued by Brits.

She had heard from a friend that the ship had been sunk by a torpedo  . I can remember the arrival of the telegram  , which in those days always brought had news. My grandmother opened it. It read, \"Safe, Love Ted.\" My most vivid memory is being woken and brought down to sit on my father's knee, his arm in a bandage. He was judged unfit to return to sea and took a shore job in Glasgow for the rest of the war. For as long as I can remember, he had a weak heart. Mother said _ was caused by the torpedoes. He said it was because of the cigarettes. Whichever, he died suddenly in his early 50s. Ten years later I read Night of the U-boats and was able to complete the story. Torpedo One torpedo struck the ship. Father was in the engine room, where the third engineer was killed. He shut down the engines to slow the ship making it easier for it to be abandoned. By the time he got on deck   he was alone. Every lifeboat was gone except one which had stuck fast. When he tried to cut it free, it swung against the ship, injuring his hand and arm. He had no choice but to jump -- still with the photograph in his pocket. Three days later, he and other survivors were safe in Glasgow. All 23 with him signed the back of the photograph. A Toast In my room is the book and the photograph. Often, glass in hand, I have wondered how I would have dealt with an explosion, a sinking ship, a jump into a vast ocean and a wait for rescue? Lest we forget, I have some more whisky and toast the heroes of the war. What is the massage mainly about?\nA.A group of forgotten heroes\nB.A book describing a terrifying battle.\nC.A ship engineer's wartime experience.\nD.A merchant's memories of a sea rescue.\nAnswer:",

        "input":"Our senses aren't just delivering a strict view of what's going on in the world; they're affected by what's going on in our heads. A new study finds that hungry people see food-related words more clearly than people who've just eaten. Psychologists have known for decades that what's going on inside our head affects our senses. For example, poorer children think coins are larger than they are, and hungry people think pictures of food are brighter. Remi Radel of University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis, France, wanted to investigate how this happens. Does it happen right away as the brain receives signals from the eyes or a little later as the brain's high-1evel thinking processes get involved. Radel recruited 42 students with a normal body mass index. On the day of his or her test, each student was told to arrive at the lab at noon after three or four hours of not eating. Then they were told there was a delay. Some were told to come back in 10 minutes; others were given an hour to get lunch first. So half the students were hungry when they did the experiment and the other half had just eaten. For the experiment, the participant looked at a computer screen. One by one, 80 words flashed on the screen for about l\/300th of a second each. They flashed at so small a size that the students could only consciously perceive. A quarter of the words were food-related. After each word, each person was asked how bright the word was and asked to choose which of two words they'd seen-a food-related word like cake or a neutral word like boat. Each word appeared too briefly for the participant to really read it. Hungry people saw the food-related words as brighter and were better at identifying food- related words. Because the word appeared too quickly for them to be reliably seen, this means that the difference is in perception, not in thinking processes, Radel says. \"This is something great to me. Humans can really perceive what they need or what they strive for. From the experiment, I know that our brain can really be at the disposal of our motives and needs. \"Radel says. What can we infer from the passage?\nA.42 participants are too small a number for a serious investigation.\nB.An experiment with hungry and non-hungry participants is not reliable.\nC.Our thinking processes are independent of our senses.\nD.Humans can perceive what they need without involving high-level thinking processes\nAnswer:",

Now, US scientists have discovered not only does retail therapy exist,but that it could be caused by an individual's fear of sudden death. Researchers found materialistic people thought terrorism and war more stressful than others. Psychologists believe the rise of materialism around the world and its treatment effect on extreme stress might be a response to fear of death caused by acts of terrorism, disease and natural disasters. The scientists from Michigan State University said people with possession obsessions often have lower self-esteem than others so are more likely to shop as the result of severe psychological suffering. Ayalla Ruvio,a business professor studying people's shopping habits while rockets fell in Israel, said, \"When the going gets tough, the materialistic people go shopping. This stress spending is likely to produce even greater stress and lower well-being. Essentially, materialism appears to make bad events even worse. Dr Ruvio led a two-part study of Israeli citizens living in a town that came under extreme rocket attacks for about six months in 2007. She compared 139 residents of the southern town with 170 from another town that was not under attack to see how their symptoms of post-traumatic stress and shopping habits varied. Dr Ruvio found that, when faced with a deadly threat, those who are highly materialistic suffered much higher levels of stress,while their tendency to shop was increased. Dr Ruvio said, \"The relationship between materialism and stress may be more harmful than commonly thought.\" The second stage of their research surveyed 855 Americans about their materialistic nature and fear of death. They found shopping was used to relieve feelings of stress and anxiety about death but this was in response to fear of a variety of life-threatening events like car accidents, criminal attacks and natural disasters. What's the result about Dr Ruvio's research?\nA.Impulsive spending does good to people's health.\nB.Shopping can't lower one's stress as it is expected.\nC.Faced with great stress, people feel hopeless for life.\nD.Faced with threat,people's wish to shop will decrease.\nAnswer:",

The principle of casual Fridays seems to have appeared around the 1950s. It was probably in response   to the changing attitudes towards workplaces. Over time, some offices have relaxed their dress rules even more by using a \"business casual\" dress rule. On casual Fridays, employees   may wear clothes which are considered to be \"business casual\", meaning they still obey certain standards  . Clothes must be clean and in good condition, with no spots. Men are generally allowed to wear casual trousers and bright-colored clothes, and in some offices they may be allowed to wear button-down shirts or polo shirts, with or without a tie. Women often wear neat skirts or dresses; casual trousers are common and generally allowed to wear, except in very formal workplaces. As a general rule, extremely casual clothes, like jeans, shorts, T-shirts, tank tops, and so on, are not encouraged on casual Fridays. Employees are still expected to make an effort to look professional, out of respect for their offices and their customers. Many people feel that casual Fridays are good for employees'mood because they encourage employees to express their individuality   and feel more comfortable in the offices.

They hate standing in line or waiting for their turn in a game or activity. They get bored pretty fast. They may also be impulsive--saying the first thing that comes to mind or interrupting someone else who's talking. For certain kids, this problem is so severe  that doctors have a name for it: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Perhaps as many as 1 out of every 20 kids under the age of 18 have characteristics of ADHD. Often, these kids have trouble getting through school and face other difficulties later in life. Rizzo started developing the Virtual Classroom in 1999.He wanted to see if he could use it as a tool for testing and treating kids who have attention disorders. To diagnose  ADHD, doctors typically test patients by giving them tasks that require attention. As part of one classic test, you watch letters flashed on a computer screen. Every time you see the letter \"A\" followed by the letter \"X\",you have to press the space bar. If you're paying close attention, you'll register all the times this combination occurs. If not, you'll miss some. The Virtual Classroom makes these tests more efficient, Rizzo says. In one experiment, he gave a group of kids the classic \"A-X\" test. Instead of looking at a computer screen in a doctor's office, though, the kids wore headsets that made it look like they were taking the test in a classroom. \"Basically what we found,\"Rizzo says,\"is that, in 20 minutes of testing with virtual reality,we replicated  a finding that usually requires a couple hours of standard testing with computer screens in the psychologist's office.\" In the experiment, patients need to press the space bar, when   _  .\nA.see letters A following X\nB.first see A then see B\nC.see letter X and A\nD.see letters A followed by X\nAnswer:",

        "input":"Plants can't communicate by moving or making sounds, as most animals do. Instead, plants produce volatile compounds   ---- chemicals that easily change from a liquid to a gas. A flower's sweet smell, for example, comes from such volatile compounds to attract insects such as bugs and bees. Plants can also discover  volatile compounds produced by other plants. A tree under attack by hungry insets, for instance, may give off these chemicals in order to let other trees know about the attack. In response, the other trees may send off their chemicals to keep the bugs away ---- or even chemicals that will attract the bugs' natural enemies. Now scientists have created a quick way to understand what plants are saying: a chemical sensor   called an \"electronic nose\". The \"e-nose\" can tell such compounds as plants make. When plants are attacked, scientists say, the e-nose could help quickly decide whether plants are being eaten by insects. But today, the only way to spot such insects is to inspect individual plants by observing them. This is a challenging task for managers of greenhouses, including those that can house thousands of plants. The research team is working with an e-nose that can recognize volatile compounds. Inside the device, 13 sensors chemically react with volatile compounds based on the interactions  , and then the e-nose will give off electronic signals that the scientists can analyze by using computer software. To test the e-nose, the team presented it with healthy leaves from cucumber, pepper and tomato plants, all being common greenhouse crops. Then scientists collected samples of the air around damaged leaves from each type of crop. These plants had been damaged either by insects or by scientists who made holes in the leaves with a hole punch  . The e-nose, it turns out, can identify healthy cucumber, pepper and tomato plants based on the volatile compounds they produce. It could also identify tomato leaves that had been damaged. But even more impressive, the device could tell which type of damage ---- by insects or with a hole punch ---- had been done to the tomato leaves. With some fine-tuning  , a device like the e-nose can one day be used in greenhouses to quickly spot harmful bugs, the researchers say. A device like this can also be used to identify fruits that are perfectly ripe and ready to pick and eat, says Natalia Dudareva, a biochemist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, India, who studies smells of flowers and plants. Hopefully, scientists believe, the device can bring large benefits to greenhouse managers in the near future.

It looks like a ring of land with trees, grass, and flowers on it. One part of the ring is open to the water. There is a little round lake inside the island. If you look into this lake, you will see beautiful coral. You may think they are flowers. If you look at a piece of coral, you will see many little holes in it. In each of these holes a very small sea animal has lived. These sea animals make the coral. They began to build under the water. Year after year, the coral grew higher and higher. At last it grew out of the water. Then the sea brought to it small trees and something else. After some years, these things changed into earth. Sometimes the wind brought seeds to this earth. Sometimes birds flew over it and brought seeds to the island. The little seeds grew. In a few years there were plants all over the island. In a few more years there were trees growing there.

        "input":"Doubt usually comes along when companies talk very proudly how socially responsible they are, but Nike's decision to publish its entire list of contract suppliers on the Internet is harder to ignore. Nike's move opens a new front in companies' efforts to face their critics. As Nike states in its latest corporate responsibility report, it is often hard to confirm exactly what is happening at about 800 factories that make its footwear and clothing under contract, many of which are remote. Nike is hoping other companies will publish their factory lists, too. Hannah Jones, Nike's vice - president for corporate responsibility, says Nike would like to see the best - run contract factories using their social position as suppliers to the big brands to try to get more work. Nike's approach moves corporate responsibility into its third age. The first age was corporate philanthropy - companies donating money to various community projects. The $170,   000,000 that Wal - Mart gave in charitable donations last year is a good example. Of course, some critics oppose even this form of corporate generosity , arguing that companies should concentrate on making profits, leaving it to shareholders to decide what charitable donations to make. Corporate responsibility's second age was reputation management and risk avoidance. Second - age corporate responsibility supporters believe agreement with the wider community can warn a company of future risks in advance. Nike is now trying to go a stage further. The company says it sees corporate responsibility as a way of improving its performance rather than just protecting its reputation. Factories which ensure that workers are registered  for social - security benefits often become more productive as a result. Attention to one aspect of staff management often leads to improvement in others. If other companies publish supplier lists, they can together work out common standards, Nike says. At present, different companies have different standards, which make life difficult for the many factories that produce for more than one brand. If other companies published suppliers' locations, they could work out common standards and save money by relying on one another's checks. What is the best title of the passage?\nA.A New Age of Corporate Responsibility.\nB.Nike's Staff Management.\nC.Big Brands Working out Common Standards.\nD.Lists of Contract Suppliers.\nAnswer:",

        "input":"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition  Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom. The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground. They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the \"disturbing schools\" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white. Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. \"I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,\" Johnson said in the statement. Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages. The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline. Fields was called to the classroom after the student refused to stop using her cellphone, and then she would not leave the classroom for a teacher or administrator. In the days after the incident, the teacher turned her class over to a substitute and the administrator was placed on leave. Richland two officials didn't respond to an email asking about their current status. The students were allowed back in school. Organizers of the protest said they plan to be at South Carolina's Statehouse next year, calling for legislators to change the law that allows police officers to arrest students for misbehaving at schools. Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott blamed that law for escalating the situation. \"Let's find a way where we don't saddle students with arrest records,\" said EfiaNwangaza from the Malcom X Center for Self Determination. \"Let's get ahead of the schoolhouse-to-jailhouse train in South Carolina.\" According to the passage, people are now concerned about the following except  _  .\nA.whether the incident reflects a racial issue\nB.when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline\nC.whether students can play cellphones in class\nD.whether the law that allows police officers to arrest students for misbehaving at schools should be changed\nAnswer:",

Cost to taxpayers for storing it: $1 million a year. And _ . Who knows what's in the rest of them? Because we think the government should be held to at least the same standards as a publicly traded company, and because as taxpayers, we're America's shareholders, we performed an audit  of sorts of the federal books. We're not economists, but we do have common sense. We tried to get help from Congressional staffers from both parties, as well as various watchdog groups and agencies. In the end, we found that the federal government wastes nearly $1 trillion every year. That's roughly equal to the amount collected annually by the Internal Revenue Service in personal income taxes. Put another way, it's also equal to about one-third of the country's $2.9 trillion total annual budget. And reclaiming that lost trillion could help wipe out the country's annual budget deficit , improve education, and provide health insurance for those who don't have it. So how do you define \"waste\"? David Walker of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a federal watchdog agency, calls it \"the government's failure to give taxpayers the most for their money.\" For our part, we used the kind of household test you would use on a piece of meat sitting in your refrigerator: If it smells rotten, it's waste. Our government regularly pays for products and services it never gets, wildly overpays companies to do things it could do more cheaply itself, loses money outright due to lax accounting and oversight, and spends money randomly on unnecessary programs.

        "input":"Every baby born a decade from now will have its genetic code   mapped at birth, the head of the worlds' leading genome sequencing   company has predicted. A complete DNA read - out for every newborn will be technically possible and affordable in less than five years, promising a revolution in healthcare, says Jay Flatley, the chief executive of Illumina. Only social and legal problems are likely to delay the age of \"genome sequences,\" or genetic profiles. By 2019 it will have become routine to map infants' genes when they are born, Dr Flatly told The Times. This will open a new approach to medicine, by which conditions such as high blood pressure and heart disease can be predicted and prevented and drugs used more safely and effectively. A baby's genome can be discovered at birth by a blood test. By examining a person's genome, it is possible to identify raised risks of developing diseases such as cancers. Those at high risk can then be screened more regularly, or given drugs or dietary advice to lower their chances of becoming ill.  Personal genomes could also be used to ensure that patients get the medicine that is most likely to work for them and least likely to have side-effects. The development, however, will raise legal concerns about privacy and access to individuals' genetic records. \"Bad things can be done with the genome. It could predict something about someone - and you could possibly hand the information to their employer or their insurance company.\" said Dr Flatley. \"People have to recognize that  _ , and that your genome probably can't be protected, because everywhere you go you leave your genome behind. Complete genetic privacy, however, is unlikely to be possible\", he added. As the benefits become clearer, however, he believes that most people will want their genomes read and interpreted. The risk is nothing compared with the gain. What's Dr Flatley's attitude towards the technology?\nA.Tolerant.\nB.Conservative.\nC.Positive.\nD.Doubtful.\nAnswer:",

For her, one thing she can't put up with is people standing on the wrong side of the escalator  in subway stations. \"Escalators help us move faster and save time. It isn't a place to rest,\" the 24-year-old says. \"I often see tourists block the way with their suitcases or chatting on the escalators during rush hours. _ annoys me to no end.\" Admitting she is not the patient type, Zhao says things are much better in Hong Kong than in cities on the mainland where \"stand right, walk left\" signs are often ignored. The logic behind the \"stand right, walk left\" escalator etiquette  seems obvious. Even though you may want to catch your breath while you're transported up or down, you should still consider others and leave enough space for people in a hurry, so that they can run and catch the train. Many cities' escalators, including London's and Beijing's, use the \"stand right, walk left\" system to speed up the flow of people. (Australia is an exception and you should stand on the left side instead.) But some cities discourage people from moving on escalators out of safety reasons. In Hong Kong's subway stations there are regular announcements asking people to \"stand still\" on escalators. Even so, most people in thisfast-paced cityobserve the \"stand right, walk left\" etiquette. But the people who stand on escalators defend themselves by telling the walkers not to be so impatient. The BBC quotes one stander as saying: \"If the person is in such a rush, why not just take the stairs? Even when the escalator is packed and there's nowhere to move, I see these same people complaining about not being able to pass.\" Whatever the escalator etiquette is in the place you live or visit, do what most people are doing and always be mindful of others: leave enough space between each other, don't stay at the end of the escalator, and if someone is blocking your way, a simple \"excuse me\" is enough. Which of the following statements is the writer's opinion?\nA.People should stand right no matter where they are.\nB.People should do as the Romans do and consider others.\nC.People should do as they like on the escalators.\nD.People should be seriously criticized when they block the way.\nAnswer:",

And, a new study suggests, the longer we are with someone, the more similarities in appearance grow. Researchers set out to study why couples often tend to look like one another. They asked 11 male and 11 female participants to judge the age, attractiveness and personality of 160 real-life married couples. Photographs of husbands and wives were viewed separately, so the participants didn't know who was married to whom. The test participants rated men and women who were actual couples as looking alike and having similar personalities. Also, the longer the couples had been together, the greater the similarities. The researchers guess that the sharing of experiences might affect how couples look. The idea that there is a connection between appearance and personality might seem strange at first, but there could be biological reasons for a link, said study member Tony Little from the University of Liverpool in England. \"The face displays our emotions and over time, emotional expressions may become written in the face,\" Little told Live Science. For example, someone who smiles a lot may develop lines and muscles that are suggestive of someone who is happy. Other studies have shown that partners who are genetically similar to each other tend to have happier marriages. The new study indicates that people have different features when using facial appearance to make decisions about someone's personality, and that the particular cues  focused on change from face to face. Vital to the decision, however, are eyes and smiles. \"Smiles are important social cues that may tell us whether or not someone is friendly, and eyes are also a traditional focus of attention,\" Little said. Overall face shape can be important too. For example, the combination of large chins and strong brow ridges can create an impression of disagreeableness and being unwilling to cooperate, Little said.

Bill Haselow, an emergency physician, said the risks are real. He treated two serious texting-while-walking injuries at the Mequon hospital in the past few months. Both teens suffered a broken nose after falling face first on a sidewalk. If you're over 25 or so, it might be hard to appreciate the popularity of exchanging word messages that you compose and read on the screen of your cell phone. But there's no doubt they have an attraction. Perez, a new college graduate, said the number of text messages she sends and receives easily exceeds the number of calls she makes and receives on her cell. Perez said her bills show she typically sends 3,000 texts per month, or an average of 100 per day.www.ks5u.com Perez said she favors texting because it's less formal than calling someone and because it's easier to communicate while doing another activity -- although she is aware now that texting and walking aren't always easy to do together. \"I only talk on the phone if I really have to,\" Perez said. The popularity of cell phones has led to efforts to limit their use. Illinois is considering a ban on walkers using wireless devices while crossing streets.

        "input":"More than a century ago, the composer and bandleader John Philip Sousa warned that technology would destroy music, who said, \"These talking machines are going to ruin the artistic development of music in this country. When I was a boy ... in front of every house in the summer evenings you would find young people together singing the songs of the day or the old songs. Today you hear these terrible machines going night and day. We will not have a vocal cord   left.\" Music has greatly changed in the past hundred years, which has been everywhere in our world: rivers of digital melody flow on the Internet or on disc; MP3 players with forty thousand songs can be put in a back pocket or a purse. Yet, for most of us, music is no longer something we do ourselves, or even watch other people do in front of us. It has become a radically virtual medium, an art without a face. Ever since Edison invented the phonograph cylinder , people have been assessing what the medium of recording has done for and to the art of music. Sousa was a spokesman for the party of doom; in the opposite corner are the utopians , who argue that technology has not imprisoned music but liberated it. Before Edison came along, Beethoven's symphonies could be heard only in select concert halls. Now the recordings carry the man from Bonn to the corners of the earth. Glenn Gould, after renouncing live performance in 1964, predicted that within the century the public concert would disappear into the electronic air. Having discovered much of my favorite music through LPs and CDs, I am not about to join Sousa's party. Modern urban environments are often so soulless or ugly that I'm grateful for the humanizing touch of electronic sound. But neither can I accept Gould's slashing futurism. I want to be aware of technology's effects, positive and negative.

The report stated much first-hand information to address the problem, but there was little discussion about how doctors, when they have made mistakes, should deal with their patients, Everyone assumes that the ever-present threat of accusation has made doctors more anxious about admitting error, and no doubt it has, But doctors have always been tight-lipped about their mistakes, in part to preserve an illusion(,) of medical omnipotence  Studies suggest that patients are less likely to accuse doctors when they apologize for mistakes, and many hospitals now encourage their physicians to admit their errors. According to an supportive group called The Sorry Works! Coalition, 16 states have already passed laws giving doctors legal immunity  for their apologies to patients. Of course, there are plenty of doctors with a nice bedside manner who can get away with bad treatment. How else to explain patients who often line up in court to support doctors accused of malpractice ? The surprising truth is that many patients have a hard time knowing whether they are really getting good medical care. Because so many diseases change randomly over time, patients sometimes spontaneously  improve despite improper treatment. On the other hand, a patient who receives exemplary medical care may fare badly  simply because the illness is hard to treat. In other words, doctors are often praised or blamed, when the outcome is in fact a chance event. Many, perhaps even most, medical errors probably have little ill effect and go unnoticed by patients. Many lawyers would disagree, but doctors ought to let their patients know when they've made a mistake; it humanizes them and builds trust. According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?\nA.The doctor made the mistake deliberately so they do not apologize.\nB.Doctors never tell the patient they have made a mistake.\nC.The patients won't forgive the doctor if he make the mistake.\nD.The patient will usually forgive the doctor when the mistake are not intentional.\nAnswer:",

        "input":"Cold weather has a great effect on how our minds and our bodies work. Maybe that is why there are so many expressions that use the word \"cold\". For centuries, the body's blood has been linked closely with the emotions. People who show no human emotions or feelings, for example, are said to be cold-blooded. Cold-blooded people act in merciless ways. They may do brutal things to others, and not by accident. For example, a newspaper says the police are searching for a cold-blooded killer. The killer murdered someone, not in self-defense. He seemed to kill for no reason, and with no emotion, as if taking someone's life meant nothing. Cold can affect other parts of the body, the feet, for example. Heavy socks can you're your feet, if your feet are really cold. But there is an expression--to get cold feet--that has nothing to do with cold or your feet. The expression means being afraid to do something you have decided to do. For example, you agree to be president of an organization. But then you learn that all the other officers have resigned. All the work of the organization will be your responsibility. You are likely to get cold feet about being the president when you understand the situation. Cold can also affect your shoulder. You give someone the cold shoulder when you refuse to speak to them. You treat them in a distant and cold way. The expression probably comes from the physical act of turning your back toward someone, instead of speaking to him face-to-face. You may give a cold shoulder to a friend who has not kept a promise he made to you, or to someone who has lied about you to others. A cold fish is not a fish. It is a person. But it is a person who is unfriendly, unemotional and shows no love or warmth. A cold fish does not offer much of himself to anyone. Out in the cold is an expression often heard. It means not getting something that everybody else got. A person might say that everybody but him got a pay raise, and that he was left out in the cold. And it is not a pleasant place to be. Which of the following expressions can best describe a person who is unwilling to offer anything to others?\nA.Cold-blooded.\nB.To get cold feet.\nC.A cold shoulder.\nD.A cold fish.\nAnswer:",

For their research, Kappelman and Dr. Richard Ketcham used a CT scanner to create more than 35,000 \"slices\" of Lucy's skeleton. Scientists named her Lucy from the Beatles song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", which was played at the camp the night of her discovery. The following analysis of the slices showed sharp, clean breaks seen at the end of Lucy's right humerus  are similar to bone breaks seen in victims of falls. The researchers concluded that these and other breaks in her skeleton show that Lucy, who is believed to have stood about 3 feet 6 inches and weighed about 60 pounds, fell feet first and used her arms to support herself -- but that the injury was too severe to have been survivable. The researchers estimate that Lucy was going about 35 miles an hour when she hit the ground after falling from a height of roughly 40 feet, according to the statement. That sounds _ . But other scientists are doubtful. \"There are countless explanations for bone breaks,\" Dr, Donald C, Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins and one of the scientists who discovered Lucy, said, \"The suggestion that she fell out of a tree is largely a just-so story and therefore unprovable.\" Johanson said it was more likely that Lucy's breaks occurred long after she died, saying that \"elephant bones appear to have the same kind of breaks, It's unlikely they fell out of a tree. \" But the new research focused on \"a small number of breaks\" that are consistent with \"high-energy bone-to-bone influences\" and which differ from the sorts of breaks commonly seen in other collected bones.

They made these tools by hitting one stone against another. In this way, they broke off pieces from one of the stones. These chips of stone were usually sharp on one side. People used them for cutting meat and skin from dead animals, and also for making other tools out of wood. Human beings needed to use tools because they did not have sharp teeth like other meat eating animals, such as lions and tigers. Tools helped people to get food more easily. Working with tools also helped to develop human intelligence. The human brain grew bigger, and human beings began to invent more and more tools and machines. The stone chip was one of the first tools that people used, and perhaps it is the most important. Some scientists say that it was the key to success of mankind. Since 1960 a new kind of tool has appeared. This is the silicon chip  . It is smaller than a finger nail, but it can store lots of information. It is an electronic brain. Every year these chips get cleverer, but their size gets smaller, and their cost gets less. They are used in watches, calculators and intelligent machines that we can use in many ways. In the future we will not need to work with tools in the old way. Machines will do everything for us. People will have plenty of spare time. But what will they do with it?

        "input":"In the early 1950s, researchers found that people scored lower on intelligence tests if they spoke more than one language. Research in the sixties found the opposite. Bilingual people scored higher than monolinguals, people who speak only one language. So which is it? Researchers presented their newest studies last month at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The latest evidence shows that being bilingual does not necessarily make people smarter. But researcher Ellen Bialystok says it probably does make you better at certain skills. Ellen Bialystok said, \"Imagine driving down the highway. There're many things that could capture your attention and you really need to be able to monitor all of them. Why would bilingualism make you any better at that?\" And the answer, she says, is that bilingual people are often better at controlling their attention -- a function called the executive control system. Ms. Bialystok is a psychology professor at York University in Toronto, Canada. She says the best method to measure the executive control system is called the Stroop Test. A person is shown words in different color1s. The person has to ignore the word but say the color1. The .problem is that the words are all names of color1s. Ellen Bialystok said, \"So you would have the word blue written in red, but you have to say red. But blue is so salient , it's just lighting up all these circuits  in your brain, and you really want to say blue. So you need a mechanism  to  _ that so that you can say red. That's the executive control system.\" Her work shows that bilingual people continually practice this function. They have to, because both languages are active in their brain at the same time. They need to suppress  one to be able to speak in the other. This mental exercise might help in other ways, too. Researchers say bilingual children are better able to separate a word from its meaning, and more likely to have friends from different cultures. Bilingual adults are often four to five years later than others in developing dementia or Alzheimer's disease.

Nearly half of these women admitted to lying about the weight of their case to their partner before leaving for the airport, in fear of being made to unload some unnecessary items. But it's a fact that women pack more than they need. On average, a woman needs around 57 items in suitcase for a two-week holiday, yet most women pack nearer to 150 items, ranging from skirts, tops, underwear and high heels. In addition, women pack more sun cream, make-up and hair appliances than they were likely to need. They all take up space in the suitcase, only a third of them will see the light of day once at the holiday place. 79 percent of women admitted to taking extra items with them, with the reason for this being \"just in case\". Women plan their holiday wardrobe  months in advance. Packing enough clothes and other items to last a month is not enough for some women. They'd take a chance to shop for new items while holidaying abroad. So they'll return with even more luggage in their cases. Professor Karen Pine said: \"Women are tempted to take familiar items with them on holiday, often everything except the kitchen sink.

In his book Beyond Laughter, psychiatrist Martin Grotjahn says that the earlier infants begin to smile and laugh, the more advanced their development is. Studies revealed   that children who did not develop these responses \"developed a schizophrenic psychosis   in later life, or simply gave up and died\". Between the ages of six months and one year, babies learn to laugh for essentially the same reasons why they will laugh throughout their lives, says Dr. Jacob Levine. He says that people laugh to express mastery over an anxiety. Adult laughter is more subtle  , but we also laugh at what we used to fear. The feeling of achievement, or lack of it, remains a leading factor. Giving a first dinner party is an anxious event for newly-weds. Will the food be good? Will the guests get along? All goes well; the party is over. Now they laugh freely. Their pleasure is from recalling the evening's activities. They couldn't enjoy the second pleasure without the first. Laughter is a social response caused by signals. Scientists have not determined a brain center for laughter, and they are puzzled by patients with certain types of brain damage who go into laughing with no apparent reason. The rest of us require company and a reason to laugh. Another reason why laughter is pleasurable is because of the physical feeling involved. According to Dr. Levine, we can measure our adjustment to the world by our capacity   to laugh. When we are secure about our abilities, we can make fun of our weakness. If we can laugh through our anxieties, we will not be overpowered   by them. The ability to laugh starts early, but it takes a lifetime to perfect. Says Dr. Levine, \"When social relationships are mastered, when individuals have mastered... a peaceful relationship with themselves, then they have ... the sense of humor.\" And then they can throw back their heads and laugh. The infant who begins to smile or laugh early will   _  .\nA.become a more subtle laughter when he or she grows up\nB.be more likely to take a whole life to perfect smiling and laughing\nC.have more advantages of development in growth and health\nD.suffer from schizophrenic psychosis and even die in later life\nAnswer:",

Researchers examined the diets of 84,493 women from 50 to 79 years old. The women who consumed a lot of baked fish like salmon received stronger benefits than those who consumed mostly tuna, grouper or white fish. The consumption of baked fish also appeared to provide protection against high blood pressure cardiovascular disease . It also found that those women who consumed more baked fish tended to have a lower body mass index , exercise more and consume more fruits and vegetables in comparison to those who consumed fried fish.     Researchers note that past research has discovered that the fatty acids in fish probably decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease by decreasing inflammation  and improving blood pressure along with heart and blood vessel functioning. This study does show the link between fish consumption and heart failure risk but it was not designed to show cause and effect.     This study also showed that just by consuming one serving of fried fish a week was linked to a 49% greater risk of heart failure. It also found that the consumption of fried fish was linked to a lower fiber intake and a higher calorie intake. Dr Lloyd-Jones, associate professor with North-western's Feinberg School of Medicine, states frequent consumption of baked fish appears to be part of a suitable pattern that is greatly beneficial for numerous things. This advocates that fish is a very good source of lean protein that we should be increasing as a part of our diet.

On the one hand, school holidays allow families to spend time together. Many American parents take time off from work during June ,July or August to travel with their children on vacation either in US or a foreign country. On the other hand, schoolchildren get much more time off school than parents get vacation time. This means that parents with young children may have to pay more in babysitting or daycare costs. As well, the long summer holidays mean that students sometimes get bored . Besides going on trips with their parents, American students enjoy taking part in different kinds of activities during the holidays. For example, some kids enjoy summer camps and outdoor adventure  holidays. Such trips are great for adventurous students. _ also have a lot to offer students who aren't usually interested in traditional PE activities. You can do courses in survival  skills, for example.

No matter how many friends you might already have, it is always a good idea to make new friends. Being shy keeps a lot of people from making friends. Also, making friends might need a person to step outside of their comfortable places, which are hard for a lot of people, whether they are shy or not. However, overcoming the shyness to step out of your box is an important step in making friends. There are lots of ways to meet new friends. First of all, remember that a good friendship is based on interests, so if you are ready to make friends, start to join clubs or go places where you have interest. For instance, if you like to play sports, join a sports team or after school sports club. If you have interests in music or writing, join clubs or organizations that you are interested in. When you see someone in a place like that, and you think that they look nice, it is always a good idea to go up to them and introduce yourself and ask interesting questions so that you can start a conversation. Don't put too much pressure on yourself, and remember that friendships don't always happen quickly. Some friendships happen right away, and you'll be able to tell if someone will be a great friend right after you meet them. Some friendships take a long time to develop.

When other rabbits see this tail moving up and down, they run too. They know that there is danger. The rabbit has told them something without making a sound. It has given them a signal. Many other animals use this kind of language. When a bee found some food, it goes back to his home. It cannot tell the other bees where the food is by speaking to them, but it does a little dance in the air. This tells the bees where the food is. Some animals say things by making sounds. A dog barks, for example, when a stranger comes near. A cat purrs  when pleased. Some birds make several different sounds, each with its own meaning.

But just a short walk from Manhattan's skyscrapers, George Brown sits on the side-walk, cooking a lunch of rice and bits of fish over a can of cooking fuel. Brown is homeless----one of the 2.3 million people in the US who end up on the street. During the day, Brown collects aluminum cans and sells them for five cents a piece. At night, he sleeps on the street. \"I have been on the street about eight or nine years, something like that,\" said the 62-year-old former construction worker. Brown admits he had problems with alcohol and has smoked cocaine. But he said he still wants a more stable housing arrangement. He could afford it just with the money he earns by collecting cans and small pieces of metal, if only truly low-income housing were available. However, he sees no hope of finding affordable housing in New York. With the strong economy and unemployment down, beautiful housing is being built to meet demand. A US report shows rents in New York City rose more than 27 per cent, from $549 to $700 a month. One of the side effects of the strong economy is that rents have been going up. The majority of people who experience homelessness really just need some affordable housing help. But few housing companies are building for the poor. Many small apartments in the city now rent for $1,500 a month or more. Brown, the homeless New Yorker, said he has a daughter who lives in the city but he rarely sees her.

There is no direct passenger access between the mainland and Taiwan by air or sea at the moment. Experts say that it is better to start research sooner rather than later,although there is a lack of government funding .There  are no technical problems t0 build a Taiwan tunnel.But it will require an improved political relationship across the Straits. A professor of TsinghHa University said,\"A special feature of  huge projects is that the period of preparation is longer than the  period of construction.\" For example,he said,the English channel Tunnel took 14 years of planning and had been discussed for two centuries.And preparations for the huge Three Corges dam on the Yangze River began in the 1950s.

        "input":"As rain begins to fall from the clouds, it is very pure. However, as it falls through the air it dissolves some of the gases in the air. It also collects bits of dust and microbes   that are floating in the air. When the rain reaches the ground it begins to pick up more dust and dirt. Many kinds of mineral substances   dissolve in the water. Sand and mud cannot dissolve in water.    Since water is so important to us, it is very important that the water we use should be clean. Otherwise, we might get some of the diseases that are carried by water. Many microbes are harmful. They are so small that we cannot see them. These microbes must be removed or killed before the water is suitable for drinking. For example, microbes of diseases like cholera live well in water. If the water supply is not clean, people who drink this water may get these diseases. Thus, to provide people with clean water, the government purifies   the water.   Purification is a long process and includes three stages: storing, purifying and distributing . The first stage is storing. Man-made lakes are used for this purpose. Water from the rains, other lakes, streams and rivers is collected in the lakes. This water is usually dirty and muddy.    In the second stage, water from the man-made lakes is filtered   in a special pond. Stones, sand and other unwanted tiny things are caught in it. After that, tiny microbes are still present in the water. These microbes are removed by \"airing\" the water and by adding a chemical substance called chlorine   to the water. This kills all the microbes in the water. After this, the water can be safely used for drinking. The third stage is the distribution of the purified water to homes, hospitals, offices, factories and other places. This is done through a network of pipes of various sizes. These pipes must be made of a suitable material. What is the purpose of adding chlorine to the water?\nA.to air the water\nB.to catch tiny things\nC.to kill tiny microbes\nD.to remove harmful gases\nAnswer:",

        "input":"A third of Britons are overweight, states a report published in January by the Royal College of Physicians, the result of an 18-month study. About five per cent of children weigh too much, and are likely to stay that way for life; in the mid-twenties-age-long group the proportion  of the middle-aged population half are overweight.     Fat people risk severe health problems, says the report, including high blood pressure, breathlessness and various forms of heart disease. Smoking is particularly risky for overweight people.     The safest way to lose weight is to eat cereals, bread, fruit and vegetables, and cut down on fatty meals, butter and sweet foods. Fad diets so far more than good; slimming machines that vibrate muscles have not been proved useful; saunas merely remove a little body water, and health farms, says the report ,serve as expensive holidays.     Exercise is most important to health, the report emphasizes; though it doesn't necessarily reduce weight; it keeps the correct proportion of body muscle. And it isn't only for the young ; from middle age a minimum of 20 minutes of gentle physical jerks should be practiced three times a week.     The report advocates several public health measures to fight the common existence of overweight in this country. They include an increase of tax on alcohol to reduce its increasing, and dangerously fattening, consumption; and the provision of more sports facilities by local authorities. Britain's doctors, the report concludes, must learn to be more sympathetic and specific in their advice to the overweight, encouraging a change in eating habits on a long-term basis and taking into account the many-often-complex-reasons why fat people are fat.

Previous research has shown that keeping food and exercise diaries improves the likelihood of success when you are trying to lose weight. Using a computer or a pen and paper to record information, however, can be a burden and cause some people to give up. Duke University researchers said using text messages to track eating and exercise habits can save time, and increase the chances that people will stick with their weight-loss rules. The study included 26 obese women with an average age of 38. The women used daily texting as part of their weight-loss program. The text messages focused on tracking personalized goals, such as avoiding sugary drinks or walking 10,000 steps a day. Messages also provided brief feedback   and tips. Every morning, the women received a text from an automated system that said, \"Please text yesterday's personal information of steps you walked and how many sugary drinks you had.\" Based on the women's responses to the text message, the system sent another text with personalized feedback and tips. After six months, the women who used daily texting lost an average of nearly 3 pounds, while another group of women who used traditional methods to keep food and exercise diaries gained an average of 2.5 pounds, according to the study, which was published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. \"Text messaging has become popular and may be an effective method to simplify tracking of diet and exercise behavior,\" Dori Steinberg, who was responsible for this research, said. Steinberg said, \"Text messaging offers several advantages compared to other self-monitoring methods. Unlike web-based diet and exercise diaries, data in a text message can be entered quickly on nearly all cellphone platforms so it is very convenient to receive feedback. Besides, because of the limited number of words used in text messages, it saves time.\" What's the best title for the text?\nA.Texting helps keep healthy\nB.Texting saves time and money\nC.Texting can help you lose weight\nD.Texting provides brief feedback and tips\nAnswer:",

The volcano, called Mount Vesuvius, formed 25,000 years ago. During its most explosive eruptions, the volcano could blanket nearby cities with hot ash, sometimes also burying them with deadly flows of mud and rocks. One famous eruption occurred nearly 2,000 years ago, in the year AD 79. It lasted 18 hours and destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, killing thousands of people as they tried to escape. Scientists and city officials had supposed that Naples, one of Italy's most populous cities, was far enough away that it would be safe from the volcano's _ . New evidence suggests that this might not be the case. Researchers recently discovered 4000-year-old layers of ash and mud under present-day Naples. Just outside the city, they also uncovered abandoned villages, as well as human and animal skeletons. Most surprising of all, the researchers say, was the discovery of thousands of footprints from the same time period, pressed into layers of wet ash that had rained from the sky. The footprints show that thousands of people were fleeing to the northwest, away from the volcano, as it erupted. Mount Vesuvius hasn't had a major eruption since 1631, but it's still very active. The discovery of the ancient ash layers, skeletons, and footprints is a warning that modern Naples, a city of 3 million people, isn't safe from the volcano, scientists say. So, when the volcano begins to rumble again, Naples should have an emergency evacuation plan ready - just in case.

Back home we refer to carbonated drinks as cold drinks. So, when he asked me to have a pop,I thought he was referring to popcorn. I said,very politely,\"No,thank you.I am not hungry.\" He had a puzzled look on his face, one that I did not figure out for at least a week or so until somebody pointed out to me that pop meant soda and had nothing to do with corn.     Speaking of pop,my very first night at Winona State University,Bangladeshi students took me to a restaurant named Papa John's. I ordered my meal and finally asked for a Pepsi.The waitress handed me an aluminum can. Now,back home we have only bottled pop drinks,and the only time I was exposed to a can was on an airplane. However,those cans were a bit different because one could open it by pulling on the tab,which came off.Imagine my embarrassment as I tried to use the same technique at the restaurant.Obviously,the tab would not come off when I struggled with the can,and I spilled the pop all over the table. My fellow Bangladeshi students and a few others at the nearby tables got a good laugh out of this.Finally,one of them showed me how to use that device.    Bangladeshi cuisine is definitely spicier and usually hotter than Midwestern food.I conveyed this to my American friends whenever we talked about cuisine.Well,last fall,I was down in Orono,Minnesota,at my friend Steve Haack's house.He had told his mother all these horror stories about how I loved \"hot\" food.So,when it was time for Sunday brunch,I found out how Steve's mother had decided to whet  my appetite.She baked some spicy enchiladas ,and she had used one full 16-ounce can of jalapeno peppers. Talking about hot--this thing was a burning.As I was swallowing platefuls of it in front of them,the Haack family were busy pouring milk,juice,or cold water down their throats to cool off the burning,Steve's dad said,\"After this,I am going to need a big cork to plug the hole in my stomach.\"So saying,he went for a second helping.     We do not have any snow in Bangladesh,so my first encounter with snow was during the end of the year in 1986 in Winona.I came out of my dorm one morning,and it was snowing! It seemed like a shower of little white feathers.I tried to catch them,but they would melt away almost instantly--so light, so soft,and so white. I walked around the campus and it was hardly cold. Everything seemed quieter and softer. If I should ever go to heaven and have a chance to have a window with a view, this would probably be one of the scenes I would like to see.

        "input":"Losing weight comes with a lot of health benefits--including making your brain sharper. Yes, it turns out that overweight may damage cognitive functions   such as memory and attention. There have been few studies of overweight and cognitive functioning, possibly because it is generally believed that it is not a primary risk cause for poor cognitive performance. Losing weight, therefore, may help improve these mental functions, according to a new research led by John Gunstad, assistant professor of psychology at Kent State University. Growing evidence suggests that being fat is linked to cognitive deficits  . So Gunstad and his team guessed that losing weight might improve mental function. For their study, they measured memory and attention in a group of 150 overweight participants, some of whom had some kind of operation for weight loss and some did not. All of the volunteers completed mental skills tests to assess their abilities of memory and attention at the beginning of the study, and again 12 weeks later. To begin with, about 24% of the patients showed damaged learning and 23% showed signs of poor memory when tested. At the end of the study, those who had lost weight after operation improved their scores into the average or above average range for cognitive functions. Scores for the volunteers who didn't lose weight dropped even further. The study helped Gunstad to find out whether losing weight had any effect on mental function. Now that he's seen the positive effect that weight loss can have on memory and attention, he says he will next study those who choose to lose weight by the traditional way--eating healthier and getting more active. He expects that losing weight in this way will have a similarly positive effect on the brain. \"If we can improve the condition with operations, then we can probably produce the same change with behavioral weight loss as well,\" he says. What is Gunstad planning to prove next in his research?\nA.Slim people are smarter than overweight people.\nB.Healthy diet is better than exercise in losing weight.\nC.Traditional ways of losing weight are better than operation.\nD.Overweight people will get smarter by taking more exercise.\nAnswer:",

        "input":"Annual holidays have become a luxury  and are no longer a staple of family life, according to government research.       A getaway of a week or more is no longer considered essential by many families and is often beyond their reach, said the analysis of what parents and children say they really need. Fashionable clothes for the children, expensive birthday parties and lots of toys are also on the list of luxuries families don't have to have. Instead, recession -hit parents are thinking of the future, and the things they want for their children centre around learning to behave properly, good education and good health.      Their picture of what a family ought to have includes a space to eat together away from the television, plenty of fruit and vegetables, and bicycles so children can get exercise.      The breakdown of necessities and luxuries was prepared by researchers from the Department for Work and Pensions(DWP) who were trying to establish an up-to-date picture of what parents say they really need.      Their findings show how families have scaled down their expectations in the face of economic difficulties -- how parents are now concentrating their attention and money firmly on the long-term interests of their children. Many believe that while it is vital for a family to do things together, day trips or weekend breaks are enough.  Spending on furniture or decorating the house was also considered luxurious, unless the state of the home was so bad it became difficult to invite visitors in.    Instead, researchers said: A family home should have an area where the family can eat together, not on their laps in front of a television. Families should be able to go on outings, overnight trips and possibly short holiday: the fact of being able to share these experiences is more important than the precise activity and its cost. Which of the following is TRUE of the researchers from the DWP?\nA.They confirm many families still need at least a week away on holiday each year.\nB.They learn it is insignificant for a family to do things with each other regularly.\nC.They want to know what parents really need in the face of economic difficulties.\nD.They found spending on furniture or decorating the house was thought valuable.\nAnswer:",

        "input":"When travelers think of an Adriatic cruise, scenes of Venice, Italy--its canals, bridges, piazzas, and stunning architecture--come to mind. It's one of the most popular cruise destinations in Europe. And for many, the sail-away from Venice, through its Giudecca Canal, is an awe-inspiring experience. Venice may be known as La Serenissima, or \"the most peaceful,\" which, however, isn't entirely accurate these days. Venetians have been increasingly concerned about the impact of tourism and the potential for an environmental disaster off its shoreline due to the number of cruise ships that enter and exit its lagoon . That's why earlier last month, Venice announced a new policy to forbid the transit  of cruise ships to the city via the Giudecca Canal. It's not that the city wants to shun the cruise industry altogether: It simply wants to force traffic further away from the landmarks along the shoreline. City officials say that most ships will now transit the Contorta Sant'Angelo Canal. Additionally, the city is _ the size of ships that can visit Venice, as well as the total number of ships that call on it on a daily basis. As of January 2014, Venice plans to reduce the visitations of larger ships (those that are 40,000 tons or heavier) by 20 percent. This effectively caps the number of ships that can enter per day to five. In November, ships heavier than 96,000 tons will not be allowed to enter Guidecca Canal at all. How the city plans to carry out the new five-ships-per-day rule remains to be seen and have yet to be announced. Which ships will be allowed passage? Will it be first-come, first-served? However they proceed, cruise line executives want their passengers to know that Venice will remain a regular port of call--even if the transit to and from the city must evolve. The new policy was issued in order to  _  .\nA.stress the accuracy of Venice's fame for peace\nB.reduce the damage to Venice's enviironment\nC.depend less on the crusie industry\nD.limit the number of toursits\nAnswer:",

        "input":"People who eat chocolate regularly tend to be thinner, new research suggests. The findings come from a study of nearly 1,000 US people that looked at diet, calorie intake and body mass index(BMI)----a measure of obesity. It found those who ate chocolate a few times a week were, on average, slimmer than those who ate it occasionally. Even though chocolate is loaded with calories, it contains ingredients that may favour weight loss rather than fat synthesis , scientists believe. Despite boosting calorie intake, regular chocolate consumption was related to lower BMI in the study. The link remained even when other factors, like how much exercise individuals did, were taken into account. And it appears it is how often you eat chocolate that is important, rather than how much of it you eat. The study found no link with quantity consumed. Lead author Dr. Beatrice Golomb, from the University of California at San Diego, said, \"Our findings appear to add to a body of information suggesting that the composition of calories, not just the number of them, matters for determining their ultimate impact on weight.\" This is not the first time scientists have suggested that chocolate may be healthy for us. Other studies have claimed chocolate may be good for the heart. Consumption of certain types of chocolate has been linked to some favourable changes in blood pressure and insulin  sensitivity. And chocolate does contain antioxidants which can help to absorb free radicals----unstable chemicals that can damage our cells. Mice fed for 15 days with epicatechin (present in chocolate) had improved exercise performance and observable changes to their muscle composition. They say clinical trials are now needed in humans to see if this is the case. But before you reach for a chocolate bar, there are still lots of unanswered questions. And in the absence of conclusive evidence, experts advise caution. While there's no harm in allowing yourself a treat like chocolate now and then, eating too much might be harmful because it often contains a lot of sugar and fat too. We can infer that free radicals_.\nA.are beneficial to our health\nB.are vital ingredients of chocolate\nC.are harmful to our health\nD.change mouse muscle composition\nAnswer:",

And researchers have suggested that dogs' origins can date back to Europe, the Near East, Siberia and South China. Central Asia is the newest and best candidate, according to a large study of dogs from around the world. Laura M. Shannon and Adam R. Boyko at Cornell University, and an international group of other scientists, studied not only purebred  dogs, but also street or village dogs. Dr. Shannon analyzed three different kinds of DNA, Dr. Boyko said, the first time this has been done for such a large and diverse group of dogs from 38 countries. And that led them to Central Asia as the place of origin for dogs in much the same way that genetic studies have located the origin of modern humans in East Africa. The analysis, Dr. Boyko said, pointed to Central Asia, as the place where \"all the dogs alive today\" come from. The data did not allow precise dating of the origin, he said, but showed it occurred at least 15,000 years ago. Greger Larson of Oxford University, who is leading a large international effort to analyze ancient DNA from fossilized bones, said he was impressed by the study. \"It's really great to see not just the number of street dogs, but also the geographic breadth and the number of remote locations where the dogs were sampled,\" he said in an email. He also praised the sampling of different kinds of DNA and the analytic methods. Dr. Larson, who was not involved with the study, said he thought the Central Asia finding required further testing. He said he suspected that the origins of modern dogs were \"extremely messy\" and that no amount of sampling of living populations will be definitive. He said a combination of studies of modern and ancient DNA is necessary.

Dorms come in all sizes. Some have suites. Six or more students may line in one suite. Other dorms have many rooms along a common hallway, usually with two students in each room .

Most colleges and universities offer singe-sex dorms, but usually males and females live in the same building. They might live on the same floors and share the same common bathrooms. They may live in the same room only if they are married. Edward Spencer is the associate vice president for student affairs at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. He says it is important to understand the rules of the building in which you will live. He advises students to ask questions before they decide about their housing. For example, if a student requires a special diet, will the school provide it ?How much privacy can a student expect ? Will the school provide a single room if a student requests one ? And what about any other special needs that a student might have? Virginia Tech, for example, had a ban against candles in dorms .

Dreams vary from person to person, an d also from time to time. But in a certain time, people share the similar dreams here I'd like to share my Chinese dreams with you. When I was a child in 1970s, poverty kept hovering   over my family, just as it did with other average families in the countryside. The unfit  second-hand clothes, rain leaking roof of old adobe  house became part of my memory. However, the worse impression is that I was feeling hungry all the time. Sometimes hunger bit me so severely that I regarded dried sweet potato slices as a delicious snack. The sharp cracks of chewing are still echoing   in my dream. At that time, my dram was getting enough to fill my cooing empty belly. In the early years of 1980s, as the reform and opening-up policy was carried out, the child dream came true. And then another dream became clearer and clearer in my mind. I must try my best to escape out of my poor and backward hometown. I worked harder at my study than most of my classmates, and, after luckily succeeding in the national college entrance examination, my dream became reality again: after graduation, I became a citizen working in a city. As the first college graduate out of a remote   village, my success set an example for my folks. They came to realize that schooling is a good way to change one's fate . In the following years, there were less drop-outs and more college graduates in my village, of which I am proud even today. Afterwards, I got accustomed to the life of citizens and I began to dream the same things as other peers: a comfortable home, my own car and a big house. Based on my hard-work, more than ten years passed, all of these dreams have been fulfilled. Of course, new dreams will come true sooner or later only if my motherland keeps advancing with current(,)pace. My Chinese dreams are also ones of other Chinese people. If every individual's dreams come true, the dream of the great rejuvenation  of the Chinese nation will be sure to come true. \"The Chinese dream, after all, is the dream of the people,\" as the Chairman Xi Jingping said. What can be inferred from the passage?\nA.The author's dreams are different from other Chinese people's dreams.\nB.The Chinese dream is based on every Chinese individual's dreams.\nC.Only if the Chinese dream comes true, can the author's dreams come true.\nD.The author and his family live a happy life in the countryside.\nAnswer:",

In the first half of 20 century, to control flooding, the city fathers began redirecting the San Antonio River. They built a network of canals that pass through the downtown area. At nearly every street corner, stairs lead down to walkways on both sides of the canals. The River Walk is linked with cafes, bars, shops --- and, of course, plenty of bridges. You can easily cross over to the other side without having to return to the street. It's a constant party along the River Walk, with music and festivals throughout the year. The Mud Festival, for example, takes place each January, when the city empties this section of the river to clean it out. That's when the Mud King and Mud Queen are crowned.

In the 19th century, train routes appeared from coast to coast, carrying both people and goods Today, a long-distance Amtrak train trip is a different way to experience the United States. The long-distance Amtrak trains have lots of room. Coach seats have lots of leg room and wide aisles ,sightseeing lounges  have large windows, and sleeping areas can provide a good night's rest. On a train trip, there's time to talk, play cards or board games, and read to one another. On a car trip, parents have to drive while on a train, parents can sit back and watch the scenery go by. Unlike an airplane, traveling by train is not the quickest way to arrive at your destination; the train is the destination in itself. Amtrak manages long-distance trains that run through the United States. Routes have different names, such as Empire Builder, California Zephyr, Sunset Limited and Southwest Chief. The long-distance trains have double-decker cars(Superliners), sightseeing lounges, and a real dining car. On shorter trains, such as from New York to Washington. DC, the cars are single level and only have a snack bar. In the Superliner trains, the sightseeing lounge is lined with windows on the second level while on the lower level a snack bar and tables can be found.

Some of this growth has occurred in the developed world, but the most dramatic increase has been in the Third World. Almost all the world's population growth over the next 30 years will take place in the cities of developing countries By the year 2030, for the first time in history, 60 percent of the world's people will be living in cities. This is actually good news in some ways. \"Cities are the fundamental building blocks of prosperity,\" says Marc Weiss, chairman of the Prague Institute for Global Urban Development, \" both for the nation and for families.\" Industrial and commercial activities in urban areas account for between 50 and 80 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in most countries of the world\" there's the crazy notion that the way to deal with a city's problems is to keep people out of them,\"Weiss continued. \"But the problems of the rural life are even more serious than those of the city.\" For better or worse, urban-watchers are clear on one point: The quality of life for most people in the future will be determined by the quality of cities. Those cities will be bigger than ever. And yet, population numbers by themselves don't determine a city's prospects; after all, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Hamburg, Germany, have the same population.

        "input":"A recent study, which was published in last week's Journal of the American Medical Association, offers a picture of how dangerous it is to get a lift from a teenage driver. Indeed, a 16-year-old driver with three or more passengers has three times the possibility of a serious accident, compared with a teenager driving alone. The authors also found that the death rates for teenage drivers increased greatly after 10 p.m., and especially after midnight. With passengers in the car, the driver was even more likely to die in a late-night accident. Robert Foss, a scientist at the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center, says the higher death rates for teenage drivers have less to do with \"really stupid behavior\" than with just a lack of driving experience. \"The basic issue is that adults who are responsible for giving out licenses fail to recognize how complex and skilled driving is.\" he says. Both he and the author of the study believe that the way to mitigate   the problem is to have states set up so-called graduated licensing systems, in which getting a license is a process with several stages. A graduated license requires that a teenager first prove himself able to drive in the presence of an adult, followed by a period of driving with night of passenger restrictions   before graduating to full driving rights. Graduated licensing systems have reduced teenage driver crashes, according to recent studies.

She started to learn the piano at the age of 4, and she sang her first song on the stage when she was 9 years old. Yao did quite well in singing, so she took part in the thirteenth Youth Singing Competition and won the first prize. She became well-known to the public after making a series of songs for the hit TV drama \"The Legend of Zhenhuan\" in 2012, and the mandarin version   of \"Let It Go\" from Disney's \"Frozen\".

Once you're in your 30's or 40's, it gets harder and harder to reinvent yourself. So I made an interview with Dr. Meg Jay, the clinical psychologist. He explains why the twenties matter, and how to make the most of them.  In Dr. Meg Jay's opinion, our 20s are the  _ decade of adulthood. 80% of life's most important moments take place by about age 35. And 2\/3 of lifetime wage growth happens during the first ten years of a career. More than half of Americans are married or are dating or living with their future partner by age 30. Personality can change more during our 20s than at any other decade in life. Female fertility  peaks at 28. The brain caps off   its last major growth. When it comes to adult development, 30 is not the new 20. Even if you do nothing, not making choices is a choice all the same. Don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do. On the other hand, I also ask him how the 20s track their progress toward their future goals and whether milestones like 21 and 30 are really important. Dr. Meg Jay think it  ly important. Milestones--21, 25, 30, New Year's, birthdays, reunions--are important because they cause self-reflection. What he mentioned are as follows: Am I where I wanted to be by this age? Did I do what I said I would do this year? If not, why not. And if not now, when? A 20-year-old girl who interviewed me recently told me about a question she was advised to ask herself as she moved through adulthood: \"If you keep living your life exactly as it is, where will you be in 3 years?\" If you don't like the answer, now is the time to change course.

Muir also wrote about problems.In order to create more farmland for sheep and cattle, rnany trees were being cut down.This made Muir unhappy and worried,because he knew that trees were important to forests and to the animals that lived in them.Muir believed that nature should be conserved instead of being changed by human beings.He wrote articles in magazines and newspapers to spread the word about conserving forests.Soon,others began to listen. Muir wrote letters to important people,such as President Theodore Roosevelt.The president admired Muir's love for nature.When Roosevelt came to visit Muir in California. Muir convinced the president to go camping with him for three nights under the trees so they could talk about conservation.Later,President Roosevelt set aside 148 million acres of land for national forests and established five national parks.National parks are large areas of land that are protected from development.

Because of his story of success, he has become an example of young people. Michael Ha was born in a very poor family. His parents worked in Vietnam before they moved to Britain in 1980. They couldn't find work in Britain because they spoke little English. The whole family had to live on benefits  and they lived in a small house in Hackney, a poor area in East London. Growing up is not easy for Michael, but he never gave up. At the age of ten, he set his heart on going to Cambridge University. It was not easy, either. Michael studied at a school, which used to be called \"the worst school in Britain\". However, young Michael made his mind to try his best, no matter what kind of school he was studying at. The smart boy studied very hard and did well in every subject at school. Once he made a bet with his friend to learn further math. As a result, after just spending four months teaching himself from a textbook, he got an A in AS-level further math. Now Michael is the star medical student in John's College, Cambridge and has just won an award for his excellent grades. He hopes he will be an inspiration for other young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

        "input":"As I made my way to my office last Thursday, I noticed an A4 poster stuck to the lift door. Then I noticed one on the wall, one on the noticeboard, and then one on my classroom door. In fact, they were stuck to nearly every available surface along the corridor. And they all had the same statement:\"All I'm asking for is a little respect seeing I pay you PS9,000 a year.\" I still don't know what led to this flyer campaign -- it is said that it's linked to a group of students who were not given extra assignment grade for their examination -- but I could not help but become annoyed at the impolite language. I started to think about the ways that my students act and speak, and the way I acted and spoke during my time at university. I will admit that I didn't do all of the readings, and yes, I may have missed a couple of lectures throughout the year, but I completed all assignments and followed the guidelines presented to me, without expecting my lecturers to chase after me. I wish I could say the same for my students. As I walked through the car park with a colleague at the end of the day, we discussed the unrest that the posters had caused:\"If you ask me,\"he said,\"all universities are going to need a customer services department before long.\"And there it was, plain and simple, the issue that I hadn't been able to explain: these young people weren't behaving like university students, they were behaving like customers. I recalled the student who told me he was disappointed with his low grade because he had\"paid so much money\". My colleague topped it: when one of his students was asked to leave a seminar for not completing the reading, he responded:\"I pay you to teach me what's in the article, not the other way around.\" Last week I sent out the first round of grades for a module and had 12 emails of complaint within an hour. One in particular stood out for its misunderstanding of what it means to be a scholar. The student said the grade must be incorrect because he had turned up to all the lectures -- as if simply hoping what I had taught him deserved a 70+ grade. As I attempted to make a polite and supportive response, I considered a few things. When did it become an expectation that turning up to lectures is worthy of reward in itself? Moreover, when I was studying would I have ever had theballsto contact my lecturers and not only question their ability to grade my work appropriately but imply that my low grade was their fault? I find that as time goes by, my students become increasingly reluctant to engage in any academic behavior that does not have a direct effect on their assignment grade. That is, after all, what they are paying for. And so I am not regarded as an academic. I am not an expert in my field, a person with 10 years' worth of industry knowledge. I am a service provider. I wish I'd had the gusto to reply to those posters.\"Hey student -- all I'm asking for is a little respect, seeing how much you pay makes no difference to my wages, yet the level of support I am forced to offer you takes up 80% of my time in spite of the fact that teaching is still only equal to 33% of my workload. But I'll be in the office until 9 pm anyway because if I don't publish two papers by the end of the year, I'll be fired.\" What the author's colleague said actually implies that    .\nA.university students have gone too far\nB.he faces a lot of challenges from his students\nC.university students think little of their teachers\nD.university teachers face more pressure nowadays\nAnswer:",

If the timetable says 8:14, the train will actually leave at 8:15.In other words, if you think you have only a minute to get that trainwell, relax. You have two.     The courtesy minute , in place for decades and published only in private timetables for employees, is meant for those who need the extra time to get off the platform and onto the train.     \"If everyone knows they get an extra minute, they're going to waste time doing unimportant things,\" explained Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for the Metro-North Railroad. Told of this article, Ms. Anders laughed. \"Don't blow our cover!\"she said.     Entirely hidden from the riding public, the secret minute is an odd departure from the railroad culture of down-to-the-second accuracy. The railroad industry helped invent the concept* of standard time, and time zones were established in the United States in the 1880s, 35 years before they were written into law. And most commuters know their train by the accurate minute it departs. The trains quickly make up the minute:at all other stops, the public timetable is carried out. The courtesy minute does not exist at commuter railroads in Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, or San Francisco. But in New York, the secret minute dates back decades.     \"That's been done forever, from my knowledge,\" said Jack Swanberg, 70, an unofficial historian of Metro-North. \"I was the trainmaster starting in 1970 and I'm sure it's been the case since 1870 for all I know.\" What can we conclude from the passage?\nA.The courtesy minute exists in many cities in the US.\nB.The train will reach the destination one minute late.\nC..Most railroad staff in New York know the courtesy minute.\nD.In American rail system, train's departure time is accurate to the minute.\nAnswer:",

Past studies have shown that early humans were able to cross the open ocean as far back as 50,000 years ago, but evidence that they could fish while in the open sea dated back only to 12,000 years ago.               \"In most areas of the world, evidence for our early ancestors' coastal exploitation   was drowned by rising sea level,\" said researcher Sue O'Connor.               Now O'Connor and her colleagues have found evidence of prehistoric fishing tools and the remains of large fish such as tuna    at a cave shelter known as Jerimalai, located in the Southeast Asian island nation of East Timor. Their discovery uncovered fishing hooks made from bone that dated back to about 42,000 years ago.               \"It's possible that people caught the tuna in the deep channel that lies off the coast of the Jerimalai shelter,\" O'Connor said.               The site, first uncovered in 2005, also included bone points, shell beads, the remains of fish, turtles, bats and birds, and nearly 10,000 stone tools. The island of Timor has very few land animals overall and only small birds call the island home, perhaps explaining why the ancient people here went fishing. About half the fish remains at the site came from fish such as tuna. Catching such fast-moving fish requires much planning and complex technology, suggesting that early humans developed these skills earlier than previously thought.               Some other scientists might say that most of the fish bones seen are from young fish, and thus might have been caught more easily off the coast as opposed to in open waters. While this may be the case, it's still not easy to catch tuna -- it requires nets set in deep water.

Hazel has been studying volcanoes for a long time, so it's not surprising she is used to the danger. Her interest in volcanoes began at school.

There have been many changes in sea level caused by global warming and melting ice caps. _ have resulted in some dormant volcanoes erupting, so studying them is more dangerous than ever before. Hazel says that although she doesn't take any unnecessary risk she has had some frightening moments. Her worst experience was on the slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily, when she was slowly surrounded by lava. \"I had a choice of walking ten hours to get around the lava flow or just walking across it,\" she explains.

And in the winter, he sculpts ice. When sculpting ice, Wardley has to work in cold temperatures. If the weather is cold enough, he can work outside. But winter in the United Kingdom is not always very cold. So often he works in a large freezer where the temperature is about -12degC. Wardley enjoys sculpting ice outside in the winter. When he sculpts in the open air, people can watch. They can be part of the creative process. Wardley makes ice sculpting sound simple. But the tools Wardley uses are sharp and dangerous. And the ice is very heavy. Each block of ice weighs 120 kilos. And some larger sculptures are made from several combined blocks of ice. Sometimes ice sculptures can be as big as buildings. In Kemi, Finland there is an ice hotel called the Snow Castle. Each year, Wardley helps build the Snow Castle. Inside the Snow Castle, the temperature is -50C. Even the dining tables are made of ice. So you have to wear winter clothes when eating and wear a hat when sleeping. \"The ice hotel is built every year in January. Then it melts in April. Each year we rebuild it and create a new design,\" Wardley said. The Snow Castle is a large and amazing work of ice, but Wardley's smaller ice sculptures are special too.

But in western countries, dogs are thought to be honest and good friends of humans. In English, people use the dog to describe positive actions. For example, \"you are a lucky dog\" means you are a lucky person. And \"every dog has its day\" means each person has good luck sometimes. To describe a person's serious illness, they say \"sick as a dog\". The word \"dog-tired\" means very tired. However, Chinese love cats very much.

        "input":"Switching telephone providers used to be the only way homeowners could save money on telephone bills. Now thanks to new technology, comsumers have another choice-making phone calls over the internet. And this can be completely free if you call another person with an internet phone set-up. The technology is called voice over internet protocol  , or VoIP. In 2005, consumer demand for VoIP dramatically grew. In the US, where popularity has grown faster than here in the UK, 8.4 million are predicted to subscribe this year. For the past couple years, VoIP pioneers such as Skype have accounted for the majority of internet phone subscribers. VoIP is attractive to consumers because it's cheaper than traditional phone services. With the basic equipment of PC, microphone and headset, and VoIP software and broadband internet for optimum   voice quality, consumers can save a fortune chatting for free to other internet phone owners and save money calling regular landlines  . But, as the saying goes, . Many of these services suffer from uncontinuous lapses   in quality. While some users may tolerate echoes or a dropped call, improved quality is needed to attract more customers. Computing has examined the benefits of using a PC as a telephone with VoIP in how easy they were to set up, how effective they were and the range of their features. Skype(www. skype.com) came top for its bother-free approach, easy set-up and exceptional voice clarity. Sipgate (www. sipgate. co. uk), MSN(www. messenger. msn. co. uk) and Yahoo!

During the day, the white walls of the lighthouse shined under the sunlight, while at night it burned a light for those at sea. Many people visited the lighthouse, and when they did, they commented on its size and strength and admired the beauty that it added to the surroundings. Some told its keeper how its light had saved them during a storm.  All loved the lighthouse except a little oil lamp that lived in the lighthouse. By day it hung forgotten at the bottom of the stairs. At dusk it helped the keeper of the lighthouse make his way from the bottom of the stairs to his bedroom. It seemed to the oil lamp that he is not important. To his way of thinking, his shortcomings were made clear by his nearness to one so much greater than he. Always, the oil lamp labored under this heaviness of heart.  Then one day, after a brilliant afternoon when many visitors had come to play on the sandy beach, there was a knock at the door. It was a boy, searching for a friend who was lost. The sun had set and what had seemed such friendly shores hours before was now dark and cold.  The keeper quickly took the youth inside and hugged him into a blanket. Then he reached to the hook between the door and the stairs and took down the little oil lamp. After carefully making sure that the tank was full of oil, the keeper lit the lamp and whispered, \"Burn bright tonight, my dear friend. I cannot take the lighthouse with me. He serves his purpose here, but you were made for times like this. It is now that I need you most!\" In that instant, all of the oil lamp's misgivings were replaced by joy---joy in knowing that here was something only he could do. All through the night, through bushes, the oil lamp burned brighter and more steadily than ever before. He had to; the keeper was depending on him. At last the lost boy was found and brought safely back to the lighthouse and his friend.  Never again did the oil lamp doubt his place or purpose. He had learned a great lesson that night: he was happiest and most useful being himself.

        "input":"Originally, both the British and the American spoke with a rhotic accent. Rhotic essentially means an accent where the letter \"r\" is pronounced strongly after a vowel  . Rhotic accents are strong in both the US and Scotland, but seem to have disappeared from British English and its _ , such as Australian English and New Zealand English. The major American accent -- the typical accent of the mid-western US -- is rhotic, and British English is, as a rule, non-rhotic. Specifically, US speakers pronounce every \"r\", wherever they appear in a word. Most British speakers (and you will note that there are some British Isle accents that are strongly rhotic, like US) do not pronounce every \"r\". Americans stress the \"r\" at the end of words such as \"teacher\" or \"neighbour\", but in many non-rhotic British accents it is more of a \"schwa\" (an unstressed sound) so it comes out as, \"teacha\" (unstressed) or \"neighba\". This main difference also differs across the country of origin. For example, the US has a clear difference in the accents between people of the north and south, not to mention less clear differences across the states. Similarly, British people have a different accent according to their locality. The \"cockney  \" accent is greatly different to the middle and upper class accents. Another common difference appears to be that Americans pronounce words such as \"herbal\" without the \"h\". Syllables   may be stressed differently, too. \"Oregano\" in the US tends to be pronounced \"o-reg-a-no\" while in British English it is more likely to be \"o-reg-AH-no\".

The government feels it has to take responsibility for this expanding problem. The cheerful Mr. Pickwick, the hero of the novel by Charles Dickens, is seen in illustrations as someone who is plump and happy. In 18th century paintings, beauty is equated (...) with rounded bodies and soft curves. But nowadays being overweight is seen as indicating neither a cheerful character nor beauty but an increased risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. So what do you do? Diet? Not according to England's chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson. He says that physical activity is the key for reducing the risks of obesity, cancer and heart disease. And the Health Secretary John Reid even said that being inactive is as serious a risk factor in heart disease as smoking. So, having bought some _ , how much exercise should you do? According to Sir Liam Donaldson, at least 30 minutes of moderate activity five days a week. Is going to the gym the answer? Luckily for those who think that running machines are boring, the Health Development Agency believes that physical activity that fits into people's lives may be more effective. They suggest taking the stairs rather than the lift, walking up escalators, playing active games with your children, dancing or gardening. And according to a sports psychologist, Professor Biddle, gyms \"are not making the nation fit\", and may even cause harm. There's new scientific evidence that too much exercise may actually be bad for you. Scientists at the University of Ulster have found that unsuitable exercise releases dangerous free radicals that can adversely (oppositely) affect normal function in unfit people. The only people who should push their bodies to that level of exercise on a regular basis are trained athletes. So, should we forget about gyms and follow some expert's advice to reduce sedentary   activities and increase exercise in our daily life? After all, getting off the bus a stop early and walking the rest of the way can't do any harm! One final thought. How come past generations lacked gym facilities but were leaner and fitter than people today?

Lenny went to the river to see what was happening. Then he saw a woman in the ice-cold water. Suddenly Lenny did not feel afraid. He kept very calm and did a very courageous thing. He jumped into the Potomac, swam to the woman, and kept her head above the water. Seventy-eight people died that day. Thanks to Lenny Sputnik, it was not seventy-nine. When you are in a very dangerous situation and feel afraid, the body automatically produces a chemical in the blood. This chemical is called adrenalin. With adrenalin in the blood system, you actually feel stronger and are ready to fight or run away. However, when you are completely terrified, the body can produce too much adrenalin. When this happens, the muscles become very hard and you find that you cannot move at all. You are then disabled with fear.

        "input":"Most children, even the youngest of children, are delighted to be around cats and dogs. But these pets carry plenty of germs and allergens , prompting researchers to ask: Are cats and dogs really safe for children? A study finds that, contrary to many parents' fears, owning cats or dogs does not increase a child's risk of developing allergies, and in fact, may actually protect them. The study's lead author, Dr. Dennic Ownby of the Medical College of Georgia, says that even he was \"very surprised\" by the results. Ownby and colleagues followed more than 470 children from birth to age 6 or 7, comparing those exposed to cats and dogs during their first year of life to those who were not. By using skin-prick  tests for detecting common allergies, the researchers found that, contrary to what many doctors had been taught for years, children who had lived with a pet were not at greater risk. Even more remarkable, children who had two or more dogs or cats had an even greater reduction, up to 77 percent, in risk of allergies. Researchers suggest this protective effect may be the result of early exposure to lots of bacteria that are carried by dogs and cats. Exposing young children to these bacteria helps\" exercise\" their immune systems early in life so that they're better able to resist allergic diseases later. There's something very important in that first year of life when the immune system is developing that we can retrain _ away from an allergic response, said Dr. William Davis. And while researchers are not encouraging parents to buy dogs or cats just to reduce a child's allergy risk, they say if a family already has one or more animals, there's no need to get rid of them. What may be the best title of the passage?\nA.How to protect your kids from allergies\nB.Your pets may be helping your kids\nC.Bacteria do good to your kids\nD.Advantages of owning pets\nAnswer:",

Here are some of the findings of a survey about hopes and dreams,and thousands of students across China took part in it.  _  We received several different answers to the question:What would you like to do after finishing your education? It seems some students would like to start work as soon as possible, so that they can help provide better lives for their parents. Other students hope to continue studying after finishing school and to go to university. Although money is important, many teenagers said they want to do jobs they enjoy.

        "input":"Googlefight is a simple service available on the Internet which offers you the chance to compare two different items and see how many hits they get on the Google search engine. The seemingly simple device has proved invaluable to users, especially to help win arguments. For example, imagine that you and your friends are arguing about who are the most popular music or movie stars, you can decide the argument by writing the names in the Googlefight boxes. Let's say that you are arguing about Jackie Chan and Jet Li. You will quickly discover that Jet Li is mentioned 16 million times on Google pages, whereas Jackie Chan is mentioned a mere 12 million times! In this unscientific way, you can claim victory for one Star over another. But teachers have come up with ways of using Googlefight which are much more useful from an academic point of view, particularly when it comes to studying languages. You can, for example, find out the frequency of two words with the same meaning, and deduce   from the answers which one is more common. For example, let's take the words \"buy\" and \"purchase\", which mean the same thing (although \"buy\" is only a verb and \"purchase\" is both a verb and a noun). It is immediately clear from Googlefight that \"buy\" is much more commonly used, with a massive three and a half billion hits, compared to only one billion occurrences for the more formal word. But the real value of Googlefight to the language learner is in determining which is the more common of two phrases. For example, \"raining cats and dogs\" is an old-fashioned English expression about the weather. Do English speakers still use it? Or are they more likely to say \"pouring down\"? Googlefight suggests the latter. \"Pouring down\" has 898,000 Google hits, whereas \"raining cats and dogs\" only has 326,000. With phrases, it's important to remember that you need to use quote marks to make the search more accurate. For example, if you type in the similar phrases \"look after\" and \"take care of \" without quote marks, the second phrase seems to be more common, but with quote marks, the result is reversed. Language teachers find it useful because   _  .\nA.there are a lot of words on Googlefight\nB.it can tell them which of the two words with the same meaning appears more often\nC.some words mean the same thing\nD.common words have a billion hits\nAnswer:",

A man can not smile like a child, for a child smiles with his eyes, whereas a man smiles with his lips alone. It is not a smile; but a grin  ; something to do with humor, but little to do with happiness.  Sir Henry Stewart was a lawyer. He was certainly successful. It is twenty years ago since he came down to our village from London. I remembered some ten years ago when he was made a King's Counsel  , Amos and I, seeing him get off the London train, went to congratulate him. We grinned with pleasure; he merely looked as miserable as though he'd received a penal   sentence. It was the same when he was knighted. He never smiled a bit. He took his success as a child does his medicine.  I asked him one day what it was like to achieve all one's ambitions. He looked down at his roses and went on watering them. Then he said \"The only value in achieving one's ambition is that you then realize that they are not worth achieving.\" I recall this incident, for yesterday, I was passing his house, and had drawn up my cart just outside his garden wall. I had pulled in from the road for no other reason than to let a bus pass me. As I sat there filling my pipe, I suddenly heard a shout of joy come from the other side of the wall. I peered over. There stood Sir Henry doing nothing less than a tribal war dance of unashamed ecstasy  . When he saw me staring over the wall, he shouted, \"Come and see. Look! I have done it at last! I have done it at last!\" There he was, holding a small box of earth in his hand. I observed three tiny shoots out of it. \"And there were only three!\" he said, his eyes laughing to heaven. \"Three what?\" I asked. \"Peach stones\", he replied. \"I've always wanted to make peach stones grow, even since I was a child, when I used to take them home after a party, or as a man after a banquet. And I used to plant them, and then forgot where I planted them. But now at last I have done it, and, what's more, I had only three stones, and there you are, one, two, three shoots,\" he counted.

Yet along my journalistic journey there have been several interviews that remain deeply in my memory. For not only did the characters of those specific people impress me, they actually influenced my life. Lynn R. Taylor is such a special person. Born in Buffalo, New York, on May 2, 1962, Lynn Taylor was just like all the other kids in her neighborhood. At the age of three she was diagnosed with Wilms Tumor, a cancer of the kidneys. Given a \"no-chance\" prediction, doctors completely removed one of Lynn's kidneys and part of another. They then predicted that if she survived to the age of five, she might possibly make ten. In the decade that followed, Lynn Taylor met and surpassed all medical experts' gloom-and-doom predictions. At the age of fourteen she was in full remission , and by seventeen, she was considered cured. Yet in this case, Lynn's medical history was far from closed. Over the next twenty-three years, Lynn earned her undergraduate degree and master's degree in economics. Then she was awarded a scholarship to study at the University of Sussex in England. There she was invited to teach and earned her second master's degree. Upon returning to Buffalo, the successful young woman engaged in a variety of high level jobs, including head of Multicultural Affairs at a local college. Recently Lynn has added a new activity to her schedule----that of a cancer hospital volunteer. It is her wish to provide living proof for patients that cancer is not necessarily a death sentence but rather, as she has proved, something to overcome. Lynn is working as a cancer hospital volunteer mainly to   _  .\nA.help the cancer patient to recover\nB.encourage the patients to fight cancer bravely\nC.help the doctors and nurses as a reward\nD.entertain the cancer patients\nAnswer:",

But a new survey in America finds almost as many also fear the online world--especially social networking sites such as My Space--and worry their kids will get in trouble with people they meet. \"The parents see the web's incredible potential , and they know their kids have to be there.\" says James Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media, which released results from a survey that looked into parental attitudes toward the Internet. \" is also what they are scared of most.\" The study was conducted online May 5-10 by Insight Research Group. It says 80% of parents are concerned about kids meeting bad people online. That's because young people who largely have grown up with the Net think of it as a social outlet , say the researchers. To young people, the benefits of giving out some personal information to reach out to friends outweigh the risks. And the study shows they are so comfortable with the medium that 78% have a personal website or blog. Parents also recognize the importance of the Internet. The survey shows 91% think the Net helps their children explore their passions, and 77% think the Internet is one of the most valuable education tools teens have. But 88% think it's important to know what their kids are doing online. Findings suggest both parents and teens need more education about using online media, Steyer says.

        "input":"How can we reduce the risk? There are four general approaches to dealing with volcanic  dangers. We can try to keep the danger from occurring-often an impossible task. We can try to change its path or reduce its impact on existing development. We can take steps to protect future development. We can also do our best to have disaster response plans in place before they are needed. Removing the Threat Clearly, there is no way to stop an eruption. We can, however, attempt to reduce the eruption's effects by strengthening structures, for example, building protective works such as walls to make lava  flow away from developed areas. Such efforts can be and have been successful, but are of limited use in a large-scale eruption. Planning for the Future Protecting future development from volcanic dangers is a simple task. Before building houses, we should judge the risk. If the risk seems too great, a safer location should be found. This type of planning is very effective, but all too often, people are drawn to the lush ,rolling land of a quiet volcano. Disaster Preparedness  When a volcano comes to life, a few weeks may not be enough time to avoid a tragedy. Planning is the key to saving lives. Well before the warning signs occur, people must be educated about volcanic dangers. Escape plans must be in place. Communication between scientists, officials, the media, and the general public should be practiced. Emergency measures must be thought out and agreed upon. If you doubt the importance of these efforts, take another look at past volcanic tragedies, such as the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz. Communication failures left the town of Armero unprepared for escape. When a deadly mudflow came down the slope , 21,000 people--90 percent of the town's people--died.

He is far from alone . More than 30 million people in China have signed up to Yu'E Bao, or \"Leftover Treasure\", only six months since its launch. Initially as the Chinese e-co mmerce group as a platform for its users to manage extra funds in their online payment accounts, Yu'E Bao is becoming something far more powerful: a straight-up substitute for traditional bank deposits  .\"There's no point in keeping money in the bank any more. This is just as reliable, more flexible and you can earn a lot more from it,\" Mr Li says. A quick hit of the Yu'E Bao application on his phone shows the Shanghai-based editor has earned more interest on his account over the past  day than 94 per cent of other local users .\"This is fun, almost like a computer game,\" he says with a laugh. For every Rmb12 that companies and individuals have deposited in Chinese banks since June, they placed roughly Rmb1 in their Yu'E Bao accounts, according to Financial Times calculations based on official data. While it remains tiny compared with total deposits in the Chinese banking system, this transfer of cash from banks to the Alibaba platform is only speeding up. In the process, it threatens to upend( ) the rules of China's state-protected financial department, break banks' profit model and shifting power to savers in a way that was scarcely imaginable at the start of this year. Other Chinese tech companies are getting in on the act. Tencent, developer of the hugely popular messaging app WeChat, is said to be designing a fund platform similar to Yu'E Bao.

Yet there are many people who do not seem to know that one's memory works in the same way. When someone says that he has a good memory, he really means that he keeps his memory in practice by exercising it regularly. When someone else says that his memory is poor, he really means that he does not give it enough chance to become strong. If a friend complains that his arms are weak, we know that it is his own fault. But if he tells us that he has a poor memory, many of us think that his parents are to blame, or that he is just unlucky, and few of us realize that it is really his own fault. Not all of us can become very strong or very clever, but all of us can improve our memory by the same means -- practice. Have you ever noticed that people who cannot read or write usually have a better memory than those who can? Why is this? Of course, because people who can't read or write have to remember things: they cannot write them down in a little notebook.

Make sure your child is up to date on their immunizations . The summer is a good time to schedule visits to the doctor's as your child is not in school, and the visit won't require that your child miss school days. 2. Encourage proper nutrition. America faces childhood obesity . This means that the percentage of overweight children is increasing each year, and this will place your child at risk of developing a variety of diseases when they are middle age or even young adults. You can start helping your child to become healthier by offering fruits and vegetables at home instead of calorie heavy potato chips and candy. 3. Get your child involved in sports activities. Activities in high school such as track and cross-country are important for socialization for your child, as well as helping to improve their health. You can get your child interested in wholesome activities by discussing with them how you enjoyed similar activities in high school. 4. _ . Many children become sexually active in junior school and senior high school, and the sooner you discuss sex with your child the sooner they will be prepared. Tell your child that there is always the possibility of infecting a sexual disease when two people have sex; and discuss with your child the use of condoms. The sooner you start having this embarrassing situation the better. 5. Know your child's friends. You can do this by inviting your child to bring their friends over to your house for a pizza night, or by chatting with them when they stop by your house. If you find your child's friend has a bad reputation, then you could consider introducing your child to a different network of people, such as through the girl\/boy scouts. Forbidding your child from seeing a certain person may only lead them to rebel and become closer to that person. 6. Discuss with your child the seriousness of drug use and abuse. Your child may not realize that using drugs can have serious consequences. Your child may get the false impression that drug use is his right. Explain to a child that saying no to drugs is their right, and that anybody offering them drugs is not their friend. 7. Help your child to avoid a life long smoking addiction by discussing with them the consequences of smoking. The sad fact is that most smokers became addicted when they were in their teenage years, and are unable to quit for long periods of time and often die many years earlier due to their smoking habit which increases the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, and a variety of medical conditions. Even if you are a smoker yourself, you can discuss with your child about how damaging smoking can be on a person's health. 8. Impress upon your child the importance of traffic rules. Tell them that it is OK to wear a seat belt in anyone's car, because it may save their life one day. If your child rides a bicycle or a skateboard, then discuss with them the importance of always wearing a helmet. As you child becomes qualified for driver's permit, you should discuss with them the importance of prevention from drinking and driving. 9. Be cautious about signs of depression in childhood. A surprisingly large number of children may become depressed, and a small number of teenagers and children commit suicide  each year. Realize that any signs of unusual depressed mood, angry outbursts, suicidal comments, feelings of hopelessness, and loss of enjoyment of activities with friends may be signs of depression.

You feel upset if your phone is getting low on power, and you secretly worry things will go wrong at work if you're not there. All these can be called \"always on\" stress caused by smart phone addiction. For some people, smart phones have liberated them from the nine-to-five work. Flexible working has given them more autonomy  in their working lives and enabled them to spend more time with their friends and families. For many others though, smart phones have become tyrants   in their pockets, never allowing them to turn them off, relax and recharge their batteries. Pittsburgh-based developer Kevin Holesh was worried about how much he was ignoring his family and friends in favour of his iPhone. So he developed an app -- Moment -- to monitor his usage. The app enables users to see how much time they're spending on the device and set up warnings if the usage limits are breached  . \"Moment's goal is to promote balance in your life,\" his website explains. \"Some time on your phone, some time off it enjoying your loving family and friends around you.\" Dr Christine Grant, an occupational psychologist at Coventry University, said, \"The effects of this 'always on' culture are that your mind is never resting, and you're not giving your body time to recover, so you're always stressed. And the more tired and stressed we get, the more mistakes we make. Physical and mental health can suffer.\" And as the number of connected smart phones is increasing, so is the amount of data. This is leading to a sort of decision paralysis   and is creating more stress in the workplace because people have to receive a broader range of data and communications which are often difficult to manage. \"It actually makes it more difficult to make decisions and many do less because they're controlled by it all and feel they can never escape the office,\" said Dr Christine Grant.

You can make people happier, healthier and more hard-working just by touching their arms or holding their hands. Doctors say that body contact is a kind of medicine that can work wonders. When people are touched, the quantity of hemoglobin  -a type of matter that produces the red color in blood increases greatly. This results in more oxygen reaching every part of the body and the whole body benefits. In experiments, bottle-fed baby monkeys were separated from their mothers for the first ten days of life. They became sad and negative. Studies showed the monkeys were more probable to become ill than other babies that were allowed to stay with their mothers. Human babies react in much the same way. Some years ago, a scientist noticed that some well-fed babies in a clean nursery became weak. Yet babies in another nursery were growing healthily, even though they ate less well and were not kept as clean. The reason, he concluded, was that they often had touches from nurses. Experiments show that most people like being touched. And nearly all doctors believe touch helps to reduce patients' fear of treatment. Of course there is time when a touch is not welcome. But even if we don't like being touched, a smile can make us feel better. Smiling increases blood flow and starts the production of \"happy brain\" chemicals. So let's have a big smile and don't forget to keep in touch.

When someone says \"Beautiful day today, isn't it?\" as you settle into that narrow elevator space, or at the bus stop, or waiting in line at the supermarket, the conversation is about feelings. The person is speaking to feel more comfortable with you and offering you a chance to feel more comfortable with him or her. Being in close proximity with strangers creates interpersonal tension. We can't help it. Tension automatically seeks resolution. What will you do? Do you notice the person now only a short distance away, or pretend not to notice? Avoidance is one strategy: never make eye contact and act as if nobody is there, even when your feelings tell you. In a supermarket checkout line you might leaf through a magazine. On elevators, we often avoid others by looking up at the floor numbers. The other strategy is to break the tension by noticing the other person. It starts with eye contact. Then we have a choice: smile, nod, make a remark or strike up a conversation. If we choose to talk, the most non-controversial   subject to talk about is the weather.

This, for those as yet unaware of such a disadvantage, refers to discrimination against those whose surnames begin with a letter in the lower half of the alphabet. It has long been known that the cars of a taxi firm called AAAA have a big advantage over Zodiac cars when customers look through their phone directories. Less well known is the advantage that Adam Abbot has in life over Zoe Zysman. English names are fairly spread between the halves of the alphabet. Yet a quite large number of top people have surnames beginning with letters between A and K. Thus the American presidents and vice-presidents have surnames starting with B and  C separately and 26 of those before George Bush took office (including his father ) had surnames in the first half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even more striking, six of the seven heads of government of the G7 rich countries are alphabetically advantaged (Berlusconi, Blair, Bush, Chirac, Chretien and Koizumi). The world's three top central bankers ( Greenspan, Duisenberg and Hayami)are all close to the top of the alphabet, even if one of them really uses Japanese characters. The same case are the world's five richest men ( Gates, Buffet and so on) . Can this merely happen by chance? At the start of the first year in primary school, teachers seat pupils, alphabetically from the front, to make it easier to remember their names. So shortsighted and small-sized Zysman junior gets stuck in the back row, and is seldom asked the improving questions by those teachers. At that time the alphabetically disadvantaged may think they have had a lucky escape. Yet the result may be worse qualifications, because they get less attention, as well as less confidence in speaking publicly. The unfairness continues. At university graduation parties, the ABCs proudly get their awards first. However, by the time they reach the Zysmans most people are a little tired. Lists of job interviews and conference speakers and attendees all tend to be drawn up alphabetically, and their readers lose interest as they plough through them.

Workers are always cleaning and fixing the hive. They even stand at the opening and fan their wings to cool the hive. Worker bees will attack anything--even people--to keep their hive safe.

        "input":"Like most parents, I worry that my child isn't getting enough sleep. Now it turns out that doctors have been warning kids don't get enough sleep for over a century--long before iPads, and texting robbed children of peaceful sleep. What's more, there's no solid scientific basis for pediatricians'   recommendations on the amount of time children need to sleep. That's the word from researchers in Australia. It turns out that children are sleeping less than those in days of old. The researchers, at the University of South Australia's Health and Use of Time Group, found that kids' nightly sleep time declined   by about three-quarters of a minute each year for the period they studied. My daughter was more likely to beg for a few more minutes of Angry Birds before bedtime.That means nowadays my daughter is sleeping about 50 minutes a night less than her grandfather who had to get up to milk the cows at 5:30 am. What hasn't changed is the predictions from health professionals on the consequences of lack of sleep. \"This is a sleepless age and more and more... we are turning night into day,\" one expert said in 1905. Back then, sleep was seen as a way to restore \"wearied brain tissue\". Children and \"clever\" children were thought to be most at risk, and most in need of energy-restoring sleep. The words may be different today, but the threats are pretty much the same. Parents are told that children risk mental and physical problems, and even obesity, if they don't get enough sleep. So the Australians looked to see how much sleep kids do need. The answer is the biggest surprise of this study--no one really knows. \"There is almost no exact evidence for proper sleep for children,\" the authors write. Their work was published in the journal Pediatrics. If children suffer from lack of sleep for long     .\nA.they will become problem children\nB.they will take no interest in their studies\nC.they will be not fit for the present society\nD.they will be poor in mental and physical health\nAnswer:",

Arjun Makhijani is president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research in the United States. He says the disaster in Japan is historic. This week, the chairman of America's nuclear agency said there is little chance that harmful radiation  from Japan could reach the United States. Gregory also said America has a strong program in place to deal with earthquake threats. No new nuclear power centers have been built in the United States since nineteen seventy-nine. That was when America's worst nuclear accident happened at the Three Mile Island center in Pennsylvania. The accident began to turn public opinion against nuclear energy. At present, about twenty percent of electricity in the United States comes from nuclear energy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would close seven nuclear power centers while energy policy is reconsidered. The European Union is planning to test all centers in its twenty-seven member nations. Developing nations are less willing to slow nuclear expansion. China said it will continue with plans to build about twenty-five new nuclear reactors . And India, under a cooperation agreement with the United States, plans to spend billions on new centers in the coming years. Nuclear reactors supply fourteen percent of global electricity. Nuclear energy is a clean resource, producing no carbon gases. But radioactive waste is a serious unresolved issue.

While fans are standing in long queues to watch the first show, others are advocating a boycott on the American movie with Chinese story elements. After \"Kung Fu Panda\", a cartoon movie telling about a panda's Kung Fu master journey, hit China's silver screens in 2008, its sequel  , Kung Fu Panda 2, was released in China just ahead of International Children's Day, adding more Chinese elements such as shadow play   and lion dancing. However, some Chinese artists and scholars argue that the movie has twisted   Chinese culture and serves as a tool to \"kidnap  \" the mind of the Chinese people. \"Children's Day should be pure. Don't turn it into a money-making day for Hollywood, and don' t fool our next generation with American fast food,\" according to an open letter to Chinese cinema managers written by Zhao Bandi, an artist hoping to boycott the \"Americanized\" movie. His move is _ by Kong Qingdong, a professor of the Chinese language in Beijing University, who said Chinese elements have become advertising products to advocate American culture. \"It is a cultural invasion,\" said Kong. In the movie, the main character called \"Po,\" a panda, is talkative, humorous, lovely, and is widely believed to be a typical American figure. However, the panda has won millions of fans in China. On China's most popular website, comments on the movie reached nearly 270 million entries. \"I won't call it a cultural invasion,\" said Li Jiayi, a Beijing university student. \"I see nothing bad for others to use our cultural elements to make a movie. I' m a huge fan of Po. In spite of being a cartoon, it is still loved by many adults like me,\" said the 25-year-old after watching the first show at midnight. Cao Hui, general manager of Shenzhen Global Digital Creations company, said: \"instead of a 'boycott', movie producers should learn from the movie to make better use of Chinese story elements.

She decided volunteering would be the path she'd take and NYU could wait. She wanted to make a difference even when others said it wouldn't be possible.

Lots of heat from the sun and a shortage of water are just a few of the challenges facing desert animals. Deserts are homes to many animals and plants. Few large animals have got used to life in the desert because their size makes it difficult to find shelter from the heat and they can't store water. In order to survive, desert animals have developed a number of ways to live in their special habitat. The most common way is staying under plants or rocks or digging underground in the heat of the day. And many desert animals stay in shelter during the day and hunt at night when it is cool. Some animals get the water they need from the insects, plants and seeds they eat, and do not need to drink. They do not have sweat glands  and pass only small amount of waste water. Some animals develop their own ways of surviving in deserts. The Thorny Devil is a kind of lizard that lives in Australian desert areas. It has a body that channels raindrops directly into its mouth when it rains. Water-holding frogs spend most of the year underground in Australian desert areas, and develop a sort of cocoon that enables them to store water to keep them going through the dry times.

And in the next 35 years, twice as many people will find themselves in that age range --including me, and probably you too! So, what activities can prevent depression as we get older? Researchers at UCLA turned to a gentle \"Westernized\" version of tai chi, the 2,000-year-old Chinese martial art  . When a group of adults over 60 on antidepressant drug therapy   attended a weekly tai chi exercise class, standard rating scales showed greater improvement in their level of depression, along with improved quality of life, better memory and cognition  , and more overall energy when compared to study participants taking the same medicine but going to a weekly health education class. \"This is the first study to prove the benefits of tai chi in the management of late-life depression, and we were encouraged by the results,\" said Dr Helen Lavretsky, a UCLA professor. \"We know that nearly two-thirds of elderly patients who seek treatment for their depression fail to achieve relief with a prescribed medication  .\" In the study, 112 adults above 60 with major depression were treated with the prescription antidepressant medicine for approximately four weeks.Among those participants, 73 who showed only little improvement continued to receive the daily medication but were also assigned to 10 weeks of either a tai chi class or a health education class for two hours per week. \"Both groups showed improvement in the severity   of depression,\" said Lavretsky. But greater benefits were noted among those participating in tai chi. This study shows that adding a mind-body exercise like tai chi, which is widely available in the community, can improve the outcomes of treating depression in older adults.With tai.chi, we may be able to treat other, coexisting medical conditions without exposing them to additional medications.\" What can be inferred from the passage?\nA.Tai chi is not a common way of exercise in the community in America.\nB.More and more people will suffer from depression in the near future.\nC.In the near future, tai chi will replace medicine in the treatment of depression.\nD.Either tai chi or a health education class does good to elderly people with  depression.\nAnswer:",

The group works mainly with college-age students, but it has also served older adults since it was formed 28 years ago. \"In recent years, mid-career breaks have been gaining more interest,\" she said. A report on adult gap years published this year by a market research company also described the potential American market for gap years as a \"sleeping giant.\" \"A gap year is a challenge for the older individual to step out of a comfort zone and take a risk. I enjoyed that side most.\" said Dr. Sinar, who kept a daily blog about his experience. His time studying Eastern medicine \"reaffirmed the reasons I went into health care,\" said Dr. Sinar, who returned to practice medicine at his old job, although he works fewer days. \"I use those experiences to provide my patients with more care,\" he added. \"And I listen better than I did before.\" George Garritan, chairman of the Department of Leadership and Human Capital Management at New York University, certainly agrees with Dr. Sinar. He said a gap-year experience could be worthwhile for employees and companies. For employees, investing in themselves and improving skill sets is a move that will benefit throughout their career. He added that returning employees feel refreshed and have given more thought to their career.

A new study suggests that moderate background noise is a better spur  to creative thinking than the sound of silence,Time magazine reported. A paper published in the Journal of Consumer Research says that the perfect working environment should buzz with a little noise. Researchers found that test subjects were at their most creative when background noise was measured at 70 decibels,the level one might find in a busy coffee shop. A nearly silent environment(50 decibels)was too quiet. Turning up the volume to 85 decibels (a jackhammer tearing up the pavement outside your building) was counterproductive-the noise became a distraction. The researchers asked 65 students at the University of British Columbia,Canada,to perform various creative tasks while noises recorded at a roadside restaurant were played in the background. In one experiment,scientists asked participants to brainstorm ideas for a new type of mattress . Test subjects had the most successful discussions when the noise in the background was noticeable but not too loud. While a quiet environment may make it easier to read a book. the authors of the study say that moderate background noise creates just enough of a distraction to force people to think more imaginatively, without breaking their focus so completely that they can't think at all. Should we all head for Starbucks to get creative? Not necessarily. Researchers found limited work time surrounded by the low-level noise of a coffeehouse is what really stimulates creativity. Equally, working in a care environment isn't good for everybody. The productivity boost was most obvious among those who were naturally creative to begin with.

She said she appreciated the government's efforts and plans to build a medical system for all people. Saying \"when fair and accessible public health services become the clear targets of a country's public health policy, people's health will improve.\"   The WTO chief said she noticed that the tasks on improving people's well-being in the report by Party chief Hu Jintao at the 17thNational Congress of the Communist Party of China included a basic medical insurance system for urban dwellers and a cooperative medical care system in rural areas.   She said recent WTO research has found that diseases are the source of poverty for 30 to 50 percent of the rural population of 737 million.   A growing number of rural people, especially the aged, are suffering from various diseases; however, few have access to decent healthcare, she told the conference.   Chan criticized the practice of allowing healthcare services to be commercialized in rural areas, warning it will cause the patients more suffering.   The government has pledged to provide its population with basic medical care by 2020.   It's expanding medical care through the Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme, a plan under which subscribers  are provided with 50 yuan($6.4) per person--20 yuan ($2.6) each from the central and local governments and 10 yuan ($1.3) from the individual.   Vice-Minister of Health Chen Xiaohong said nearly 85 percent of the country's rural area, or 2,429 counties, are participating in the plan.

It was breathtaking. It was wonderful and a bit of frightening. It was Qomolangma, the highest mountain in the world. For many years, it has attracted tens of thousands of people who tried to climb its dangerous slopes. During May's 60th anniversary of the first successful climb, nearly 600 people from around the world, including a 5-year-old Italian boy, tried to reach the \"roof of the world\". China Central Television(CCTV) also sent a team to join the adventure. It broadcasted a special program, called \"Standing at the world's third pole in 2013\", from May 18 to 24 to cover the Chinese climbing Qomolangma. Over the last century, the 8848-metre-high peak has proven a great challenge for mountaineers. Those who try to stand on top of the world do so at great risk from extremely cold, avalanches , and falling ice. At 8,500 meters, the air contains just one-third of the oxygen at sea level, requiring most climbers to use oxygen tanks. Some of those who climbed the mountain paid the highest price---175 people have lost their lives on the slopes.      On May29, 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary from New Zealand and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay from Nepal became the first men ever to reach the top of the mountain. Nearly half a century later, the sons of the two pioneers, Peter Hillary and Jaming Tenzing Norgay, followed in their fathers' footsteps. In 2002, they also successfully reached the roof of the world.      Over the last 60 years, more than 10,000 men and women have tried to climb the mountain and more than 1,200 have succeeded. The first Chinese climbers reached the top of the mountain in 1960.      Despite the dangers, many different people are drawn towards the challenge. But why do they suffer such hardship and take such risks to climb Qomolangma?      \"I don't think climbing the mountain is blindly risky. Instead, it's a chance to challenge oneself,\" said Chen Qi, a reporter of CCTV.

The researchers refer to this practice as \"parenting by lying\".\"We are surprised by how often parenting by lying takes place,\" said LEE.Though Heyman thinks that there are occasions when it is appropriate to be less than truthful with a child, she urges parents to think through the issues and consider alternatives before using lies.\" Children sometimes behave in ways that are disruptive or are likely to harm their long - term interests,\" said Heyman.\"It is common for them to try out a range of strategies, including lying, to stop them.However, parents should be concerned about the possible long - term negative consequences tochildren's beliefs about honesty.\" The study of Gail Heyman, Diem Luu and Kang Lee was focused on parents'lies that  _  .\nA.aim to cover their mistakes\nB.lead children to hate them\nC.aim to give children a positive influence\nD.make children get used to lying\nAnswer:",

        "input":"Besides containing attractive flowers, trees and other plants that beautify the community, eco-friendly rain gardens are healthy for the environment and the people living and working nearby. A rain garden  is not very different from a traditional garden. It is just a far more eco-friendly garden. Usually it is built lower than the ground. Rain gardens make smart use of rain and storm water by temporarily holding water from rain and storms and letting it soak slowly into the ground before it runs into streams or enters the public drinking water supply. Thus, a rain garden keeps the water, allowing it to be used as needed by plants in the rain garden, rather than flowing immediately into nearby streams and going unused. The water will soak slowly into the ground within a day or two. This creates an advantage that the rain garden does not allow mosquitoes to breed. This is a simple, attractive, and eco-friendly \"green\" way to treat storm water. What's more, planting a rain garden helps reduce pollution and improve the environment. Without using expensive machinery and chemicals, rain gardens remove harmful chemicals in the rainwater and cut down on the amount of pollution reaching streams and rivers by up to 30%. Native plants are recommended for rain gardens because they are more used to the locals climate, soil, and water conditions. They may attract local wildlife such as native birds. Water your rain garden immediately after planting and once a week, unless you have had at least an inch of rain during the week. Once the native plants establish the necessary root system, it will require little care. Often, local governments and private businesses develop large rain gardens in their yards and in public parks as a way to improve the environment and solve flooding problems. However, you don't need to be a professional environmental engineer to create a rain garden. As long as you're eco-conscious homeowners, you can help the environment by building smaller rain gardens in your yards. Which of the following is NOT RIGHT for the function  of rain gardens?\nA.They are good for living conditions.\nB.They increase pollution.\nC.They can beautify the community.\nD.They improve the environment.\nAnswer:",

College Avenue, one of the streets laid out as part of the Meadowview development, abuts Whiteacre, an adjacent one-acre parcel owned by White. Whiteacre has no access to any public way except an old, poorly developed road which is inconvenient and cannot be used without great expense. White sold Whiteacre to Breyer.

Only half true. The real aim of an interview is to obtain the job you want. That often means rejecting job offers you don't want! So before you please an employer, be sure you want the job. Myth 2: Always please the interviewer Not true. Try to please yourself. Of course, don't be hostile--nobody wants to hire someone disagreeable. But there is plainly a muddle ground between being too ingratiating and being hostile. Myth 3: Try to control the interview Nobody \"controls\" an interview. When someone tries to control us, we resent it. When we try to control others, they resent us. Remember you can't control what an employer thinks of you, just as he can't control what you think of him. So he is ready to give and take when being interviewed; never control the interview. Myth 4: Never interrupt the interviewer Study the style of the effective conversationalists: they interrupt and are interrupted! An exciting conversation always makes us feel free--free to interrupt, to disagree, to agree enthusiastically. Just _ Try being yourself for a change.

Even if you're visiting for fewer days, it's a deal (the pass costs $ 229 for visitors ages 10 and up, $ 183 for kids ages three to nine and is free for kids under age three).

The prices at some of the nicer restaurants, especially those in Epcot's World Showcase, are much lower at noontime than at dinner. It's wise to make reservations before you leave home. Call 407-W-DISNEY. * Become a Gold Card Member. For $65, you can get a Magic Kingdom Club Gold Card (call 1-800-56-DISNEY). Card-holders get up to 20 percent off Disney hotel rooms, plus price breaks on character breakfasts, theme park tickets and goods from Disney stores. * Don't pay extra to see a character. Character-theme dinner shows are expensive, costing a family of four about $ 140, and even a character breakfast, where Mickey or Donald Duck joins you for cakes, can  _ $ 50. If your budget is tight, try to meet the characters inside the theme parks and at free in-park shows. You can watch the Diamond Horseshoe show, for example, in theMagicKingdomfor no additional cost, while the similarly themed Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue requires expensive tickets. * Wait until the end of your trip to buy souvenirs.

        "input":"During the past Spring Festival, many children may have received red packets from their families. But Xing Pu, a 40-year-old economist, is asking the government to give red packets to every Chinese citizen. Xing suggested the government give out 1,000 Yuan to each Chinese since the government income has increased rapidly in recent years. He said his suggestion would allow everyone to directly enjoy the fruits of the country's economic success, help the lower-income groups deal with rising prices and increase consumption around the country. Recent years have seen the government carry out a series of pro-poor   and pro-rural policies, including increasing spending on public healthcare and calling off the agricultural tax. But the lower-income group still needs more help while being hit hard by an 11-year high in prices and recent snowstorms. Xing said while making the draft, he has borrowed many ideas from practices in countries like the United States and Singapore. Earlier this year, the governments of the two nations offered cash handouts to their citizens as the result of a surplus in government income. As for in China, \"We can even encourage the rich to donate their 1,000 Yuan red packet to the poor,\" said Xing. Although Xing's suggestion has gained wide support among ordinary Chinese on the Internet, many other economists criticized it as unpractical. Even Xing himself admitted he made the suggestion without any careful calculation. But they agreed with Xing's point that the growing economic pie should be shared among the people. \"To better use the increase of money, handing out money is not a solution that holds good for all time. It could be better to improve the public service or cut the price of energy use in daily life,\" said Qiao Xinsheng, an economic professor. Xing Pu's ideas of giving red packets to every Chinese citizen mainly came from   _  .\nA.children receiving red packets from their families\nB.the US and Singapore governments offering cash handouts to their citizens\nC.the government's increasing spending on public health care\nD.the rising prices in the country\nAnswer:",

        "input":"It would be interesting to discover how many young people go to university without any clear idea of what they are going to do afterwards. If one considers the enormous variety of courses offered, it is not hard to see how difficult it is to select the course most suited to his interests and abilities. If a student goes to acquire a broader perspective of life, to enlarge his ideas and to learn to think for himself, he will undoubtedly benefit, since school often has too restricting an atmosphere, with its timetables and disciplines, to allow him much time for independent assessment of the work he is asked to do. Most students would, I believe, profit by a year or so's exploration of different academic studies, especially those \"all-rounders\" with no particular bent. They should have longer time to decide in what subject they want to take their degree, so that in later life they do not look back and say, \"I should like to have been an archaeologist. If I hadn't taken a degree in Modern Languages, I shouldn't have ended up as an interpreter, but it's too late now. I couldn't go back and begin all over again, even if I had the chance.\" There is, of course, another side to the question of how to make the best use of one's time at university. This is the case of the student who excels in a particular branch of learning, is a first-rate mathematician, scientist, linguist and what you have. He is immediately accepted by the university of his choice, and spends his three or four years becoming a specialist, emerging with a first-class Honors Degree and very little knowledge of what the rest of the world is all about. It therefore becomes more and more important that, if students are not to waste their opportunities and, incidentally, the taxpayers' money, there will have to be much more detailed information about courses, more advice from Career Masters and Course Tutors if  _ are not to bring up, on one hand, a band of specialists ignorant of anything outside their own subject, and on the other hand, an ever-increasing number of graduates qualified in subjects for which there is little or no demand in the working world.

        "input":"Food picked up just a few seconds after being dropped is less likely to contain bacteria  than if it is left for longer periods of time, according to the findings of research carried out at Aston University's School of Life and Health Sciences. The findings suggest there may be some scientific basis to the \"5 second rule\" --- the belief about it being fine to eat food that has only had contact with the floor for five seconds or less. Although people have long followed the 5 second rule, until now it was unclear whether it actually helped. The study, undertaken by final year Biology students and led by Anthony Hilton, Professor of Microbiology at Aston University, monitored the transfer of the common bacteria from a variety of indoor flooring types (carpet, cement floor etc.) to toast, pasta, a biscuit and a sticky sweet when contact was made from 3 to 30 seconds. The results showed that: Time is a significant factor in the transfer of bacteria from a floor surface to a piece of food; and the type of flooring the food has been dropped on has an effect, with bacteria least likely to transfer from carpeted surfaces and most likely to transfer from cement flooring surfaces to moist  foods making contact for more than 5 seconds. Professor Hilton said: \"Consuming food dropped on the floor still carries an infection risk as it very much depends on which bacteria are present on the floor at the time.\" The Aston team also carried out a survey of the number of people who employ the 5 second rule. The survey showed that: 87% of people surveyed said they would eat food dropped on the floor, or already have done so. 55% of those who would eat or have eaten food dropped on the floor are women. 81% of the women who would eat food from the floor would follow the 5 second rule. Professor Hilton added, \"Our study showed that a surprisingly large majority of people are happy to consume dropped food, with women the most likely to do so. But they are also more likely to follow the 5 second rule.\" What is the main idea of this passage?\nA.The food which is dropped on the floor can be eaten safely.\nB.The bacteria have no negative effect on the safety of food.\nC.A research on the safety of food dropped on the floor is undertaken.\nD.People surveyed in the research are willing to accept the idea.\nAnswer:",

        "input":"Spanish explorers called them Las Encantadas, the Enchanted Isles, and Charles Darwin used his studies of the islands as the foundation for his theory of natural selection. The Galapagos are among the world's most important scientific treasures, a group of volcanic islands surrounded by deserted beaches and inhabited by unique varieties of giant tortoise, lizards, and birds. Yet life on this United Nations world heritage site has turned sour. Battles have broken out between fishermen and conservationists. Ecuador, which owns the islands, has sent a naval patrol   to put down disturbances. The controversial director of the Galapagos National Park--which controls 97 percent of Galapagos land and the reserve extending to 40 miles offshore--has been fired, while an air of uneasy tension hangs over the islands, as the islanders prepare for election when they pick their representatives in Ecuador's national assembly. \"It's a very tense situation,\" said Leonor Stjepic, director of the London-based Galapagos Conservation Trust, which raises money to help projects on the islands. \"We are watching it with concern.\" The violence has been triggered by an alarming growth in the islands' population. Puerto Ayora, on Santa Cruz island, housed just 45 inhabitants in the 50s. Today there are more than 10,000, while the islands' total population is more than 19,000 and growing by 6 percent a year, despite recently introduced a law to limit waves of immigrants fleeing the poor areas of Ecuador for a life \"in paradise  \". On top of _ , more than 100,000 tourists visit the islands every year. Such numbers have put the islands, special ecology under intense pressure. Conservationists backed by the Ecuador government, have replied by exercising strict controls to protect the islands* iguanas, blue-footed boobies, and giant tortoises. These moves have angered many local people, however. They want to exploit   the islands' waters and catch its protected species of sharks, lobsters and sea cucumbers, which can fetch high prices in Japan and South Korea. Angry fishermen surrounded the Charles Darwin research station on Santa Cruz last February, threatened to kill Lonesome George--the last surviving member of the Pinta Island species of the Galapagos giant tortoise. The situation got improved after the Ecuador government made concessions   by increasing fishing quotas  , which angered conservationists. \"It is tragic, the short-term gain of a few fishermen versus the long-term survival of the Galapagos,\" said John McCosker of the California Academy of Sciences. \"They are killing the golden goose.\" Then, the Ecuador government appointed Fausto Cepeda as the national park's new director, a post that has become a political football for the mainland government. There have been nine directors in the past 18 months. This appointment was particularly controversial, however. Cepeda was known to have close ties with the fishing industry, and the rangers  ,who run the national park and reserve, rebelled. More than 300 staged a sit-in at the park's headquarters and prevented Cepeda from taking up his post. A battle broke out, and at least two people suffered serious injuries. Eventually, Cepeda--with the fishermen's help- entered the park. \"I am in office, i am in control. And I am trying to lower the tension,\" he announced. The Ecuador government _ , and sent a patrol boat to maintain the peace. A few days later, Ecuador Environment Minister Fabian Valdivicso met representatives of rangers. After discussions, he told newspapers that he had decided to remove Cepeda from the post. However, as the population continues to rise, the long-term pressures on the islands are serious and will not disappear that easily. \"We have to balance its special environment with the needs of local people. In that sense, it is a microcosm   for all the other threatened parts of the world. So getting it right here is going to be a very, very important trick to pull off,\" said Stjepic. What is the primary contributing factor to the conflict between conservationists and fishermen?\nA.The dismissal of the previous director of the Galapagos National Park.\nB.The exploitation of the islands.\nC.The government's support of Galapagos Conservation Trust.\nD.Cepeda's close tie with the fishing industry.\nAnswer:",

In crowded buses and trains people manage to take a short nap and some even reach the snoring stage. Or they spread out a newspaper over multiple knees and arms to read about the latest sport results or political crisis. Then there are the experienced travellers who have been playing cards with the same group over the last decade or so. They even have their specific seats so well-worn that you can make out the shape of their backsides. There is no doubt about it. Travelling by public transport is being in the thick of the seasons of life -- a sweaty life in summer where people, blissfully unaware of the rivers of sweat running down their brows and inside their clothes. At the first smell of a perfumed man or woman boarding the stuffy bus or train, most people feel they are reborn. During the rains you can't avoid getting wet or muddied. The windows, almost always, are not a perfect fit and if you're not drenched by a sudden, heavy rain shower then you are bound to catch a jet spray of muddy water caused by a fellow motorist driving fast through a puddle. Rains are a perfect time for people to switch their old umbrellas for new ones. Since there are so many that look alike, it's impossible to tell whose is whose. Winter is the time when it feels good -- or at least warm -- to be part of a crowd. It is amazing how much the collective breaths of a 100 or so people can raise the freezing temperature inside. Looking at the masses dressed in their bright red pullovers or green coats, it's fun to imagine what faces lie beneath their dark woolen hats. The cold winter passes, making way for spring. It is impossible not to see every little flower by the wayside blooming proudly. And the warm sun manages to transmit some of their pleasantness to the inside of a bus or train.
